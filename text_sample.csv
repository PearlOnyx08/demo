"In Phase Sunpower looked at Thermoacoustic Stirling Heat Engines (TASHEs).  These ranged from a TASHE which was sized for the heat from a single General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS), to a larger unit sized for a Venus mission.  We also looked at different types of cooler to produce both electrical power and sensor cooling for the Venus application.  Computer projected performance and layout drawing were created for all the machines investigated.   In Phase II we plan to fabricate, test, and develop the single-GPHS sized coaxial. TASHE designed in Phase I."
"The UARS Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) level 2 Atmosphere X-Ray Imaging Spectrometer (AXIS) unit 1 daily product contains the X-ray high-resolution spectral data converted to number intensity units from the AXIS1 pixels mounted on the UARS body. PEM was flown on the UARS spacecraft to measure the type, amount, energy, and distribution of charged particles injected into the Earth's thermosphere, mesosphere, and stratosphere.

The PEM AXIS1 X-ray data cover roughly the energy range from 2 keV to 300 keV. There are eight AXIS1 pixels mounted in the AXIS1 housing, each viewing different directions. The AXIS1 pixels are aligned on the spacecraft to project about 45 degrees toward the +x-axis direction from the Earthward pointing direction (+z-axis). Each pixel of AXIS1 is staggered about the 45 degree direction in an every-other fashion. Pixel 1 is closest to the center line of the spacecraft and Pixel 8 is furtherest away; however, their ground projection is dependent on the spacecraft orientation.

There is one data file per day for the PEM AXIS1 product, and the temporal coverage is from Oct. 1, 1991 to Aug. 23, 2005. Spatial coverage for the AXIS1 product ranges between -80 and +80 degrees latitude. The AXIS1 data files are written in network binary format. For more information please review the PEM AXIS1 data format guide."

C-STAR data were collected at 37GHz (in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum) for the period of 8 Aug 2001 through 24 Sept 2001. The CAMEX-4 missions studied hurricanes over land and ocean in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, Caribean, and Western Atlantic Ocean, and made use of multiple aircraft and research-quality radar, lightning, and radiosonde sites."
"The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on the Global Change Observation Mission - Water 1 (GCOM-W1) provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.  Near real-time (NRT) products are generated within 3 hours of the last observations in the file, by the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) at the AMSR Science Investigator-led Processing System (AMSR SIPS), which is collocated with the Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC) DAAC.  The GCOM-W1 NRT AMSR2 Unified L2B Half-Orbit 25 km EASE-Grid Surface Soil Moisture product is a daily measurement of surface soil moisture produced by two retrieval algorithms using resampled Tb (Level-1R) data provided by JAXA: the Normalized Polarization Difference (NPD) algorithm developed by JPL and the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) developed by USDA.  Ancillary data include time, geolocation, and quality assessment.  Data are stored in HDF-EOS5 and netCDF4 formats and are available via HTTPS from the EOSDIS LANCE system at https://lance.nsstc.nasa.gov/amsr2-science/data/level2/land/.  If data latency is not a primary concern, please consider using science quality products.  Science products are created using the best available ancillary, calibration and ephemeris information.  Science quality products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth's geophysical properties to support science.  The AMSR SIPS produces AMSR2 standard science quality data products and they are available at the NSIDC DAAC.  Note:  This is the same algorithm that generates the corresponding standard science products in the AMSR SIPS.  With this beta release, we are generating NRT products in both HDF-EOS5 and netCDF with CF metadata. Version 2 corrects these issues from the previous release: a boundary condition error that resulted in the failure of a small number of version 1 product files and an error in the number of low resolution scans processed which caused only the first half of each scan to be processed."

"The proposed innovation is a microfluidic device designed to effect a 2-dimensional resolution of a mixture of proteins based on isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (MW).  The innovation performs tasks similar to those performed by 2-dimensional (""2-D"") gel electrophoresis. To achieve 2-D-gel equivalence with minimal complications and maximum exploitation of the advantages provided by microfluidics a novel approach is proposed.  In this approach the user dissolves or mixes a sample to be tested for proteins into a sample buffer and injects this into a plastic card consisting of microfluidic channels and electrodes.  The card is inserted into a compact ""reader"" (small enough for space flight) that, within four hours, electronically reports the abundance of each protein detected.  In Phase II research SHOT will (1) establish fabrication parameters for the card and manufacture prototypes, (2) build a breadboard reader and (3) test the Microfluidic Analytical Separator using mixed protein solutions. The innovation is useful in detecting specific protein ratio changes in blood or plasma, in extracts of experimental organisms subjected to varying environmental conditions, and in the medium-resolution high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical agents."

"The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) is the successor to ENVISAT's Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) having additional spectral channels, different camera arrangements and simplified on-board processing. The OLCI is a push-broom instrument with five camera modules sharing the field of view. The field of view of the five cameras is arranged in a fan-shaped configuration in the vertical plane, perpendicular to the platform velocity. Each camera has an individual field of view of 14.2&#186; and a 0.6&#186; overlap with its neighbors. The whole field of view is shifted across track by 12.6&#186; away from the sun to minimize the impact of sun glint. OLCI is equipped with on-board calibration hardware based on sun diffusers. There are three sun diffusers--two 'white' diffusers dedicated to radiometric calibration and one dedicated to spectral calibration, with spectral reflectance features. The native resolution is approximately 300m, refered to as Full Resolution(FR). A Reduced Resolution (RR) processing mode provides Level-1B data at sampling rates decreased by a factor of four in both spatial dimensions resulting to resolution of approximately 1.2 km."
"This data set provides sea ice extent for the Arctic (60-90 degrees North) and Antarctic (52-90 degrees South) in Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) binary image format, along with ASCII text files containing latitude and longitude coordinates along the sea ice edge, and browse images of SIR files in Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format. Ancillary products include daily-averaged total sea ice extent in ASCII format. Estimates of sea ice extent were produced from daily-averaged QuikSCAT sigma-0 measurements and extend from 19 July 1999 to 31 December 2009.

QuikSCAT obtains 12 individual radar normalized backscatter (sigma-0) measurements, called slices, for each footprint as it scans over a 1800 km wide swath. Slices are typically 4 to 6 km long by 20 km wide. The summed measurements of the slices are called egg measurements. The effective resolution and shape of each egg measurement is approximately 20 by 30 km, depending on the antenna beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for each day.

The Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence, and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between sea ice and ocean. Sea ice extent was estimated for both slice and egg images. The nominal pixel resolution of the slice images is 2.225 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 4 km. Egg images have a nominal pixel resolution of 4.45 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 8 to 10 km.

Data and browse images are available via FTP, along with C, Fortran, and Interactive Data Language (IDL) tools to read and display the SIR images."
"This project will advance optical communications interlinking between small spacecraft using pulse position modulation. The Miniature Optical Communications Transceiver (MOCT) consists of a novel software-defined pulse modulator, integrated laser system, and avalanche photodetection system.

"CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens. The NONA infusion and cure of autoclave prepreg materials allows the manufacture of large primary composite structures without the expensive and energy-intensive capital equipment currently required for fabrication. The NONA process enables the remote fabrication of complex, integrated structures, dramatically shifting the composites manufacturing paradigm. Qualified autoclave or OoA prepreg tapes can be applied simultaneously with dry unidirectional (UD) tapes in an automated process. The presence of dry fibers throughout the layup before infusion allows improved breathing, removal of volatiles from prepreg, and improved compaction with only atmospheric pressure, mimicking the double vacuum debulk (DVD) process without the added equipment. NONA resin is then introduced to the evacuated layup at ambient temperature to wet out all available contact surfaces and cure itself and the prepreg in place. The NONA epoxy resin uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure with no external heat required. With a high degree of crosslinking, the baseline NONA resin provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 degrees F. Pairing NONA resin with a compatible prepreg, such as IM7/Cycom 977-3 or Hexcel IM7/8552-1, a cure of both systems can be achieved at room temperature. Because the cure occurs at room temperature, the NONA resin locks in its shape near room temperature, thus allowing the use of low-cost tooling materials, typically avoided because the of high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)."

"During Phase I of this effort, ZONA Technology, Inc. significantly improved the medium fidelity design and analysis capability of NASA's MDAO architecture by successfully adding ZONA CAE tools such as ZAERO, ZEUS, ASTROS and ZMORPH synergistically integrated within a ModelCenter MDAO framework. In Phase II of this effort, ZONA aims to improve all the three tiers of NASA's MDAO architecture as follows: (1) The low fidelity capability will be enhanced by incorporating ZONAIR for providing flight loads (for structural design) and pressure differential (for sonic boom mitigation). ZONAIR will also 'flexiblize' rigid CFD loads for aeroelastic analyses, (2) the medium fidelity capability will be further extended by addition of new ModelCenter plug-ins and improvements in the existing plug-ins for ZONA CAE tools, for facilitating ease of design process, and (3) the high fidelity analyses capability will be augmented by the development of supportive software offering beneficial features such as automated surface+flowfield mesh morphing/generation, commonality of input within all branches of fidelity, etc. Rapid shape sensitivity generation capability will be offered with incorporation of ZEUS-DO into the framework. For ease of model-making and input setup process, a pre/post-processor software called ZONA-MV will be further improved with linkage to NASA's VSP tool. A NASTRAN-to-ASTROS finite element model converter will be developed. The overall development outcome of Phase I+II effort will then be combined as a 'ModelCenter.ZONA MDAO Pak' with on-demand cloud computing ability, unlimited tokens for massively parallelized optimization efforts, and will be perpetually licensed within all NASA Research Centers."
"<p>The current generation of spacecraft and terrestrial water recovery technologies are often prone to failures caused by biofouling and mineral scaling, which can clog mechanical systems and degrade the performance of capillary-based technologies. These failures require expensive and time-consuming maintenance and resupply, and the technologies are therefore limited to environments where these resources are available. Long duration spaceflight applications, such as extended stays at a Lunar Outpost or during a Mars transit mission, will increasingly benefit from water recovery hardware that is generally more robust and operationally sustainable over time, and that minimizes the impact of fouling and hardware failures.</p>

<p>Our proposed water recovery concept takes advantage of the partial gravity on Mars or the lunar surface, while also being microgravity compatible. This will allow for a single water recovery system for both transit and planetary mission phases. This next-generation solid-state water recovery system for spacecraft will exploit a combination of advances in three areas of research, in order to manage wastewater recovery without rotating phase separators or chemical pretreatment. These research areas are:</p>

	<li>Capillary geometries for passive phase separation;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Nanoparticle-enhanced pasteurization of urine wastewater through localized surface plasmon resonance in lieu of oxidizing pretreatment chemicals, thereby minimizing consumables; and</li>
	<li>Leidenfrost-mediated fouling-free capillary distillation, accomplished in a heat pipe exceeding the Leidenfrost temperature to achieve contact-free vapor generation.</li>

"State of the art virtual reality requires low latency, on the order of single-digit milliseconds to present a scene to an operator using immersive tracking devices. In conventional teleoperation, the operator's movements are used to directly control a remote camera, requiring a fast response time to avoid simulator sickness, an approach not feasible for interplanetary robotic control with limited bandwidth, high latency communications. The proposed work develops a hybrid architecture to present a model of a coarse virtual world to an operator, while the real imagery slowly refines the presentation as bandwidth allows. An online physics engine allows an actuation command in the virtual world to be faithfully executed in the real world without direct operator feedback. The end goal is a smooth, visually realistic operator interface that allows for remote operation of an exploration vehicle in a blended world scene of virtual and actual data."
"This Phase II program will develop novel laser transmitters needed for planned airborne and space-based active remote sensing missions. This program will build on successful Phase I work to provide a Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL-4) laboratory brassboard demonstrator of a new laser source for Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) measurements of atmospheric water vapor with secondary capability for methane characterization as well. Accurate measurements of both atmospheric constituents are critical to the understanding of global energy transport and climate change. Under our Phase I program, Fibertek successfully demonstrated the capability of a new laser source, a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Er:YAG laser to generate millijoule output near 823 nm that was tunable through water-vapor absorption lines for DIAL measurements. The new laser system offers simplicity and efficiency that will reduce risk for future airborne and space-based missions. Significantly, the new laser approach offers an upgrade path with reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption over current state-of-the-art DIAL based on less-efficient non-linear parametric conversion of diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. This new-generation technology reduces the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable airborne and satellite payloads. In Phase II we propose to build on our successful Phase I demonstration to develop a full scale water vapor laser transmitter source, meeting or exceeding requirements for planned DIAL instruments."

"<p>The FMEA Assistant tool offers a new and unique approach to assist hardware developers and safety analysts perform failure analysis by using model based systems engineering concepts. Users make several selections about their component's functions and inputs/outputs, then the tool recommends for consideration a list of potential failure modes based on a common failure modes list compiled over the course of several major human spaceflight programs.  The FMEA Assistant Tool can help the hardware developer and safety analyst identify early opportunities to design out failure modes, thereby prevent the need for re-design, and can save cost and schedule. <p/><p>The FMEA Assistant guides the analyst through a set of questions about component attributes, including subsystem type, kinds of resources used, and types of outputs.  The chosen attributes narrow down the number of possible choices of failure modes that make sense for that component.   The analyst need only consider a few small sets from the full list of common failure modes to find the appropriate ones.  The dialog is dynamic, so that the choices of failure modes presented change if the analyst changes the attribute selections. The tool also has extended the use of standardization by offering short lists of common failure causes and effects for each failure mode.   Two new features have recently been added: support for choosing hazards associated with identified failure modes and effects, and a library of standard components (e.g., valve, gauge, latch) with pre-selected failure modes.   </p>"
"Spectrometers currently employed or under development by NASA are based on a printed circuit board (PCB) including field programmable arrays (FPGAs) and a number of other discrete components. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) based spectrometer offers a great reduction in weight, volume and power consumption compared to the FPGA/PCB based implementation. This proposal aims to develop a radiation-hardened (RH) low-power (LP) poly-phase spectrometer (PPS) ASIC. 
The proposed RH LP PPS ASIC aims to achieve a 4GHz bandwidth and 214 (16384) frequency bins. In order to implement the required functionality and meet the specifications while consuming below 2.5W of power, the proposed ASIC will include a state-of-the-art ADC, a demultiplexer, a poly-phase filter bank, a windowing function, a fast-Fourier-transform core, a fast-Fourier-data analysis block, a data readout, a digital control unit and testing features. Tolerance to at least 4Mrads of total ionizing dose (TID) radiation and immunity to the single event effects (SEEs) will be achieved by employing radiation hardening by design, by layout, and by system techniques and also by applying an ultra-thin gate oxide technology for implementation. Low power consumption will be achieved by employing special multiplier-less-accumulators and multiplier-less-""butterflies"". The power consumption will be further reduced by switching off the unused ASIC's blocks, down rating the clock frequency, eliminating unnecessary buffering and applying the 28nm CMOS technology. 
Phase I work will provide the proof of feasibility of implementing the proposed spectrometer ASIC. Phase II will result in the silicon proven ASIC's prototypes ready for commercialization in Phase III."

"Abstract ======== The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset includes Map Projected High- Incidence Angle Basemap Illuminated from the East RDRs (HIEs) which comprise a global map of I/F measured by the NAC or WAC filter 7 (both centered near 750 nm) during the the Extended Mission at high incidence angles to accentuate subtle topography, photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 256 pixels per degree. The HIE data set is a companion to the Map Projected High-Incidence Angle Basemap Illluminated from the West RDR (HIW) data set. Together the two data sets are intended to detect and allow the mapping of subtle topography. They complement a Basemap Data Record (BDR) data set also composed of WAC filter 7 and NAC images acquired at moderate/high solar incidence angles centered near 68 degrees (changed to 74 degrees in the final end-of-mission data delivery), and a Low Incidence Angle (LOI) data set also composed of WAC filter 7 and NAC images acquired at lower incidence centered near 45 degrees, analogous to the geometry used for color imaging. The map is divided into 54 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE, SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile also contains 5 backplanes: observation ID; BDR metric, a metric used to determine the stacking order of component images, modified for the higher incidence angle centered near 78 degrees; solar incidence angle; emission angle; and phase angle."
"In this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) effort, Leiden Measurement Technology LLC (LMT) proposes to design and build the Wholly-integrated Optofluidic Laser-induced Fluorescence Electrophoresis Chip (WOLFEChip), a microchip capillary electrophoresis (MCE) system using a miniaturized optofluidic approach for packaging all optical elements necessary for laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) on-chip. WOLFEChip uses cutting-edge laser micromachining to fabricate fully-three-dimensional optical elements that focus excitation laser light into a MCE microchannel to excite fluorescence. The fluorescence emission is collected using a heat-bonded lens on the backing layer. This improves on current and past implementations of MCE-LIF by (1) greatly miniaturizing the optical elements which comprise a significant amount of space in MCE-LIF systems; (2) making the entire LIF optical system monolithic and immune to misalignment which greatly enhances the vibration-resistance of the entire system; (3) making the system immune to operator-to-operator variations caused by the periodic need to carefully  align traditional MCE-LIF systems; and (4) greatly reducing measured stray light and thereby potentially increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MCE-LIF system by employing right-angle excitation/emission optical geometries and through the use of high-quality fluorescence-free fused silica."
"The MODIS/Aqua Atmospherically Corrected Surface Reflectance 5-Min L2 Swath 250m, 500m, 1km NRT, short name MYD09, is computed from the MODIS Level 1B land bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (centered at 648 nm, 858 nm, 470 nm, 555 nm, 1240 nm, 1640 nm, and 2130 nm, respectively). The product is an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance for each band as it would have been measured at ground level if there were no atmospheric scattering or absorption.

"An extensive validation experiment was conducted in September 1995 from Wallops Island, Virginia, to evaluate the performance of the LASE (Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment) system for the measurement of water vapor profiles under a wide range of atmospheric and solar background conditions. During this experiment, the LASE system was flown on a high-altitude (ER-2) aircraft on ten missions for a total of 60 hours. LASE measurements of tropospheric water vapor were compared with in situ measurements from balloons and aircraft that were flown under the ER-2 and with remote measurements from the ground and from aircraft. A high-altitude aircraft (Lear Jet) was equipped with two in situ hygrometers, and a medium to low altitude aircraft (C-130) had onboard the NASA Langley airborne water vapor DIAL system and two in situ hygrometers. Several radiosondes were launched during each LASE flight, and some of these sondes were part of a concurrent international radiosonde intercomparison campaign sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization. The NASA Goddard Scanning Raman lidar also provided nighttime water vapor profile measurements from the ground. During this field experiment, LASE was also used in a number of atmospheric case studies including measurements of Hurricane Luis, a coastal sea breeze development, a strong cold front, an upper level front, and cirrus clouds."

"In this Phase I STTR project for NASA, Concrete Solutions Inc (CSI), together with the University of Texas at Austin (UTA), will develop a detailed research plan that will provide for an acoustic liner that is capable of withstanding high exhaust temperatures up to 3,000 F over a range of sound frequencies.  

Using CSI?s patented product, SoundSorb, a cementitious material that is used extensively in the transportation industry to attenuate the reflection of highway and railway noise, the CSI/UTA team will develop (1) Formulation and testing of SoundSorb, or variants thereof, that will meet the requirements of sound absorption, heat and vibration for the target application; (2) Develop an application system or process that can be used to manufacture acoustic liners of this material; and (3) Develop a scale model to validate and demonstrate that the material can meet or exceed the requirements of the liners.

SoundSorb? has been tested under several ASTME testing regimes required by various governmental and transportation organizations. It has passed all these tests for acoustic behavior, durability and extreme weather conditions.  This project will show feasibility for use in this application.

In Phase II, CSI/UTA will produce prototype liners for testing in actual launch conditions."

"<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">A high cycle life and high energy density rechargeable battery would address an important need for a reliable power source that offers significant weight reductions in several NASA mission and program applications including energy storage devices for extravehicular activities (EVA), satellites, robots, and spacecraft vehicles. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage devices for NASA missions because of their high theoretical gravimetric energy density of 2500 Wh/kg, which is up to 5 times higher than today&rsquo;s commercial lithium-ion batteries. However, their use has been limited by poor cycle life caused by dissolution of polysulfide species from the cathode into the electrolyte during cell operation. In Phase I, Giner will develop a novel coating approach that blocks polysulfide shuttling to realize a Li-S battery with improved cycle life.</p>"

"The overall goal of the SBIR effort is completion of Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 5, component validation in a relevant environment, of the key photonics devices for a diode-based, locked wavelength, seed laser system currently being developed for space-based, High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) measurements. To achieve this goal, AdvR is proposing to the utilize the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE-FF) Flight Facility for accelerated and accurate testing of the key materials and components of the seed laser system, all of which have been successfully integrated into NASA High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) flight missions, but none of which have been in a space environment. Exposure and successful operation of AdvR developed materials and devices in a relevant space environment will complete the TRL 5 requirements for this technology and allow advancement to TRL 6 for the system, thus directly addressing the need for space technologies already developed under the NASA Langley SBIR Program that would mature in TRL due to successful demonstration in the space environment, as described in the NASA SBIR topic H8.01 ISS Utilization and Microgravity Research."
"The MODIS/Terra Total Precipitable Water Vapor 5-Min L2 Swath 1km and 5km (MOD05_L2) product consists of atmospheric column water-vapor amounts. This product is derived from data collected by the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite. There are two different algorithms used to derive total precipitable water vapor in this data product: a near-infrared algorithm and an infrared algorithm. The near-infrared algorithm relies on observations of reflected solar radiation in MODIS's near-infrared channels, thus, the near-infrared retrievals are only produced during the daytime over surfaces that reflect near-infrared energy. As a result, the near-infrared algorithm is only applied over clear, cloud free land areas of the globe and above clouds over both the land and ocean. Over clear ocean areas, water-vapor estimates are provided over extended sun glint areas. Data produced by the near-infrared algorithm are generated at a 1-km spatial resolution. 

The other algorithm is the infrared algorithm which can be used to derive atmospheric precipitable water vapor profiles during both day and night. Data from the infrared algorithm are generated at a 5-km spatial resolution when at least nine field of views (FOVs) are cloud free. The infrared-derived precipitable water vapor is generated as a component of product MOD07, and is simply added to product MOD05 for convenience. There are two MODIS Precipitable Water Vapor products: MOD05_L2, containing data collected from the Terra platform; and MYD05_L2, containing data collected from the Aqua platform. This dataset has a short name of MOD05_L2 and provides data from the Terra platform only. 

The MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS) is currently generating an improved version 6.1 (061) for all MODIS Level-1 (L1) and higher-level Level-2 (L2) & Level-3 (L3) Atmosphere Team products. The decision to create a new improved Collection 6.1 (061) was driven by the need to address a number of issues in the current Collection 6 (006) Level-1B (L1B) data, which have a negative impact in varying degrees in downstream products. It should be noted that the near-infrared algorithm refinement for this product is no longer being supported by NASA and as such there has been no update to this algorithm for Collection 6.1.

"A Tool for the Evaluation of Proposed TFM Initiatives, Phase I"
"We propose to develop and test the key transmitter and receiver systems for a spaceborne active microwave occultation

sounder system making two-dimensional tomographic atmospheric composition observations with unprecedented spatial

resolution (~500m vertical, 10km along track). The measurement approach employs multiple small (e.g.,

6U-“CubeSat”-class) transmitters orbiting in the same plane and flight direction as a separate (larger) receiver

instrument. The transmitters emit continuous distinct tones, and the receiver observes all transmitters simultaneously

and continuously, in an occultation viewing geometry. The vertical resolution of the measurements is set, to first

order, by the along-orbit spacing of the transmitters, with the horizontal resolution set by signal to noise and

radiative transfer considerations.

We will develop the transmitter and receiver elements for such a system operating in the 183-GHz region, incorporating

state-of-the-art technologies. The specific science target for this measurement system relates to the impact of

small-scale processes (notably overshooting deep convection) on lower stratospheric (~15–20km) water vapor, and hence,

given water vapor’s role as a greenhouse gas, on climate. Straightforward retuning of the transmitters and receiver

(including, potentially, in orbit) enables high resolution measurements of other species, notably ozone, for which other

small scale processes (e.g., those driving exchange of air between the stratosphere and troposphere) play important

roles in the Earth system.

The transmitters will use a CMOS-based ASIC to generate tones in the 10–11GHz range that will then be up-converted to

183–184GHz using a heterodyne mixer driven by a low-power local oscillator ASIC. The receiver will use a MMIC LNA-based

front end subsystem developed under the ACT program, in combination with a new FPGA-based digital spectrometer. In

addition to being suitable for “stand-alone” flight, the receiver could be incorporated as an additional channel on a

future passive microwave limb sounding instrument, such as that being developed to continue and augment the record from

the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder.

The components used for the transmitters and receiver are currently at TRL-4 or higher. We will design, fabricate and

test the transmitter and receiver subsystems and systems, and validate them in laboratory and ground-to-ground

configurations. Air-to-air testing will also be performed using a pair of high-altitude balloons, establishing TRL-6 for

the measurement approach and its proposed implementation."

A novel composite material ablative TPS for planetary vehicles that can survive a dual heating exposure is proposed. NextGen's TPS concept is a bi-layer functional composite. The top ablative layer is a two polymer composite layer formed in a conformal shape by infiltrating ablative polymer in a Si based polymeric foam with controlled pore size distribution.  This layer is for the aerocapture portion of the mission. Underneath it is a ceramic foam core sandwiched between a top ceramic ply and the bottom structural laminated composite substrate. This layer is for the entry portion of the mission. The Si based polymer foam core is similar to the top layer but is already pyrolyzed and is not infiltrated with ablative polymer. The proposed TPS when subjected to aerodynamic heating at high integrated heat loads the foam polymer structure pyrolyzes to the high temperature structure and the filled phenolic or epoxy resin will be charred and ablated. The TPS will be designed to minimize areal density while meeting bondline temperature and ablation rate requirements. The proposed TPS is easy to fabricate in aerodynamic body conformal shapes by simple manufacturing steps. The basis for the proposed concept is recent successful TPS development work performed by NextGen Aeronautics and the University of Washington under the Air Force program.
"We propose a sensor system capable of remotely probing the molecular composition of cold solar system targets (asteroids, comets, planets, moons), such as from a spacecraft orbiting the target. The spacecraft would be equipped with a high-power laser and an infrared spectrometer, both powered by photovoltaics. The laser is directed at a spot on the target, with central flux in the 10 MW/ m2 range. For rocky targets, melting and evaporation of surface and shallow sub-surface material occurs. Due to phase changes, the spot temperature rapidly equilibrates at ~2500 K, but the flux is insufficient to dissociate most molecular species present. Blackbody radiation produced by the heated spot peaks near 1 μm, and travels outward through the evaporated plume. Fortuitously, the equilibration temperature of the heated spot emits peak radiation right in the spectral range where absorption occurs due to molecular rotational and vibrational modes. The heated spot is viewed by the spectrometer through the plume, and absorption lines can be exploited to infer the molecular composition of the target. The remote sensing system uses an artificial backlighted source, and relies on absorption of radiometric energy to determine molecular composition of the target, suggesting the designation Remote Laser Evaporative Molecular Absorption (R-LEMA) Spectroscopy Sensor System. The system is complementary to existing methods such as Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). The LIBS laser produces sufficient flux to vaporize and ionize the target material; the LIBS optical spectrometer observes characteristic emission from materials in the plasma, allowing determination of the atomic composition of the target.

Our Phase I efforts produced an end-to-end model of the sensor system, and simulated operational scenarios were explored. The model includes laser propagation and absorption by a simulated target. Absorption of laser energy drives heating, melting and evaporation of the target material. Evaporation in space environment conditions is predicted, leading to estimates of plume density in front of the heated spot. Finally, plume characteristics are used to calculate the expected absorption spectrum at the spectrometer. Additionally, preliminary experiments were performed to test some aspects of the model, including plume density and absorption.

All results obtained during Phase I indicate that the proposed sensor system concept is viable. We estimate the sensor system concept to be TRL-2 at the culmination of Phase I. The Phase II effort would potentially push the system concept from TRL-2 to TRL-4, by building a proof-of-concept laboratory model and running extensive experiments to test the theory developed in Phase I. In particular, Phase I results suggest the heated spot will produce sufficient blackbody flux to be viewed from a distance, i.e., flux is not the limiting component of the system. Phase I results also suggest that much of the absorption occurs within about one spot radius from the target. Thus, spectral detection is limited primarily by ejecta concentration, which is in turn controlled by the spot area where sufficient flux is delivered to produce evaporation. Any operational system should therefore seek to maximize evaporative spot area with available laser power.

For the Phase II effort, we propose to execute advanced laboratory experiments to measure parameters of interest, and to compare experimental results to analytical predictions that were developed in Phase I. The Phase II effort would potentially push the system concept from TRL-2 to TRL-4. During the Phase II grant period, we would also develop a roadmap to TRL-5, by specifying a cubesat experiment that could be executed in low-Earth orbit, over a modest distance in the space environment."

"CubeSats enable a wide range of important, low-cost space missions, leveraging increasing densification of electronics and communications equipment to perform tasks previously in the realm of much larger spacecraft. CubeSats in sizes of 3U-12U are a promising platform for future NASA exploration and science missions, including lunar remote sensing, NEO exploration, and planetary defense, but currently lack the high Î”V propulsion required for these exciting applications. Ion thrusters are currently the best option for low power, mN range EP as required for high Î”V SmallSat missions. These thrusters are inherently more efficient than other options such as RF or Microwave, and are capable of high total impulse. This work aims to realize these advantages at the low power, miniature scale.

I propose a multi-pronged approach for the improvement of the TRL 4 MiXI thruster for miniature spacecraft and precision flying applications. By incorporating lessons learned from the UCLA Plasma and Space Propulsion Lab's MARCI experiment, the discharge efficiency of MiXI will be improved to that of larger, conventional ion thrusters, resulting in a final system with >70% total efficiency, under 100W operation, Isp >1500s, >1000m/s Î”V capability on 3-12U CubeSats, and 0.1-1.55mN thrust. 

Computational simulations and experimental validations will be undertaken to optimize the MARCI discharge for a miniature ion thruster, which will then be integrated into the heritage MiXI thruster. New grids will be designed for the resulting change in discharge conditions. Flight-worthy miniature cathodes will be implemented as electron sources for the discharge and beam neutralization while minimizing propellant and power usage. The resulting enhanced MiXI will be characterized within the Plasma & Space Propulsion Lab's Miniature Electric Propulsion Test Facility to establish throttle curves and performance. Lifetime will be assessed through a 1000-hour grid life validation test and extended to 30000 hours through NSTAR models. Finally, the thruster will be assembled into a complete propulsion subsystem and tested within a spacecraft analog in simulated space conditions for TRL 6 maturation.

This development effort promises to enable low power missions with high Î”V, high propellant efficiency, and high electrical efficiency. Miniature ion thruster development is a NASA identified enabling technology for missions in planetary science, heliophysics, and astronomy, with the primary application of SmallSat and CubeSat primary propulsion. This work will address the primary obstacle for widespread adoption of miniature ion thrusters. This will be accomplished by dramatically improving the electrical efficiency of MiXI through the implementation of a novel discharge topology, and demonstration of a propulsion system capable of >1,000m/s Î”V for SmallSat missions."
"Future detectors and arrays for visible, IR, and submillimeter imaging and spectroscopy require much higher speed digitizers than are currently available. In particular, low-power (< 5 W) space-qualifiable digitizers with > 5 GHz bandwidth and > 5 Gs/s sampling rates are needed to enable next generation digital submillimeter spectrometers. These digitizers must also provide data reduction and interface to typical digital processing logic using e.g. LVDS-compatible I/O. To meet these needs, Hittite proposes an innovative digitizer combining a high-speed (10 Gs/s), wideband (10 GHz), moderate-resolution (4 -- 6 bit) ADC with a companion digital demux to reduce the data rate and present LVDS-compatible outputs to e.g. Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs. The proposed SiGe HBT technology offers high reliability and radiation tolerance for space missions. A conceptual design will be developed in Phase I, and prototype digitizer modules produced during Phase II. Although a two-chip solution is initially proposed to reduce development risk, the technology will facilitate a single-chip solution during Phase III to further reduce size, weight, and power while improving system reliability."

The SORCE SOLSTICE Mid-UV Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) data product SOR3SOLMUVD is constructed using measurements from the SOLSTICE MUV instrument, which are combined into merged daily solar spectra over the spectral range from 180 to 310 nm at a spectral resolution of 1 nm. Irradiances are reported at a mean solar distance of 1 AU and zero relative line-of-sight velocity with respect to the Sun. The SOLSTICE absolute uncertainty better than 5%.

All of the SOR3SOLMUVD data are arranged in a single file in a tabular ASCII text file which can be easily read into a spreadsheet application. The columns contain the date, Julian day, minimum wavelength, maximum wavelength, instrument mode, data version number, irradiance value, irradiance uncertainty, and data quality. The rows are arranged with data at each wavelength over the full SOLSTICE FUV wavelength range, repeating for each day for the length of the measurement period."
"Starting from August 6th in 2019, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI along-track high spatial resolution (~5.5km at nadir) has been implemented. S5P_L2__AER_LH_HiR data collection contains the high spatial resolution products. For data prior to August 6th of 2019, please check S5P_L2__AER_LH data collection.

The Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm).  Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.

Copernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI aerosol layer height algorithm applies a forward model, which includes DISAMAR (Determining Instrument Specifications and Analyzing Methods for Atmospheric Retrieval, a Layer-Based Orders of Scattering algorithm) to calculate monochromatic reflectance, and also employs a neural network scheme for speedy processor performance. Data retrieval uses the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM) for spectral fitting with various aerosol layer pressures and aerosol optical thicknesses in the Oxygen-A band (758 -770nm). The aerosol baseline model assumes a single uniformly distributed aerosol layer with a fixed pressure thickness and a constant aerosol volume extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo. The aerosol parameterization is particularly suitable for elevated non-scattering aerosols such as volcanic ash, desert dust and biomass burning plume. The product main outputs include the mid-pressure and mid-altitude of aerosol layers, aerosol optical thickness at 760nm, error estimates, and other relevant diagnostics."
"The MODIS Near Real Time (NRT) Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global 500m SIN Grid product, MYD09GHK, is a seven-band product computed from the MODIS Level 1B land Bands 1-7. The product is an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance for each band as it would have been measured at ground level if there were no atmospheric scattering or absorption. The correction scheme includes corrections for the effect of atmospheric gases, aerosols, and thin cirrus clouds; it is applied to all Level 1B pixels that pass the Level 1B quality control. The correction uses Band 26 to detect cirrus clouds, the approach used in MYD04 and MYD05 for water vapor, aerosol correction, and NCEP for ozone; the best available climatology data are used if the MODIS water vapor, aerosol, or ozone products are unavailable.The Level 2G surface reflectance product is the input for the generation of several land products: 8-day Surface Reflectance, Vegetation Indices (VIs), Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), thermal anomaly, snow/ice, and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation/Leaf Area Index (FPAR/LAI)."

"The TES Aura L3 CH4 data consist of monthly averages of atmospheric Methane for atmospheric species. Data are provided at 2 degree latitude X 4 degree longitude spatial grids and at a subset of TES standard pressure levels. The TES Science Data Processing L3 subsystem interpolates the L2 atmospheric profiles collected in a Global Survey onto a global grid uniform in latitude and longitude to provide a 3-D representation of the distribution of atmospheric gasses. Daily and monthly averages of L2 profiles and browse images are available. The L3 standard data products are composed of L3 HDF - EOS-EOS grid data. A separate product file is produced for each different atmospheric species. TES obtains data in two basic observation modes: Limb or Nadir. The product file may contain, in separate folders, limb data, nadir data, or both folders may be present. Specific to L3 processing are the terms 'Daily' and 'Monthly' representing the approximate time coverage of the L3 products. However the input data granules to the L3 process are complete Global Surveys; in other words a Global Survey will not be split in relation to time when input to the L3 processes even if they exceed the usual understood meanings of a day or month. More specifically, Daily L3 products represent a single Global Survey (approximately 26 hours) and Monthly L3 products represent Global Surveys that are initiated within that calendar month. The data granules defined for L3 standard products are 'daily' and 'monthly'. L3 data is provided at uniform grids in latitude and longitude and at selected pressure levels.

"The proposed innovation is a robust, bio-inspired, and self-contained sensor array for the measurement of shear stress.  The proposed system uses commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) components to create a distributed sensor array for the measurement of shear stress in either a flight or ground test environment.  The reusable sensor array requires no external wiring or power source.  The bio-inspired system is based on mimicking the sensitivity and response of a single hair fiber/receptor neuron to sense flow velocity very near a surface.  An array of the hair cell inspired shear sensors are embedded in a flexible, self-adhesive backed sheet of polymide substrate, which also contains a self-contained, battery operated acquisition system.  The self-contained blanket array can be quickly and easily applied to aircraft or vehicle surfaces in question.  No wiring, external power, or control is required.  After testing, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  In addition to measurement of shear stress, the sensor array should be able to determine laminar/turbulent boundary-layer transition locations, laminar/turbulent separation and reattachment lines, and shock locations.  The proposed bio-inspired shear sensor array promises to provide a robust, realizable, accurate, efficient, and cost effective measurement system."

"Thorleaf Research, Inc. proposes to develop a miniaturized in situ atmospheric probe sampling inlet system for measuring chemical and isotopic composition of the atmospheres of the giant planets, with special emphasis on NASA needs for missions to Uranus and Saturn. Our innovative design will provide a constant flow rate of sample to the inlet of a mass spectrometer (MS) in spite of more than a hundred-fold variation in external atmospheric pressure, allowing the detection sensitivity of the MS to be optimized over the full descent profile of the atmospheric probe, unlike previous sampling systems that depended on fixed leaks. This addresses a key technology gap for planetary studies, mainly how to acquire and prepare samples for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints. Based on our analysis, we project a system mass on the order of 0.5 kg and an average power consumption of <0.5 watt, depending on materials and the configuration selected. The goal of our proposed SBIR Phase I effort is to demonstrate feasibility for a miniaturized in situ atmospheric probe sampling inlet system for Uranus and Saturn, and to develop a detailed design for fabricating prototype instrumentation in Phase II."

"Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is a geometric technique: it measures the time difference between the arrival at two Earth-based antennas of a radio wavefront emitted by a distant quasar. VLBI precisely locates points on Earth by comparing radio signals from a quasar radio source located in deep space received at different times at different Earth ground stations. This method gives relative positions of the Earth stations. VLBI data can be used to calculate information on Earth rotation, length of day, polar motion, baseline and velocities of stations. Products generated by VLBI contribute to research in many areas, including solid Earth, tides, studies of the vertical, fundamental astronomy, and VLBI technique improvement. More information about these data and products are available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/VLBI/VLBI_data_and_product_archive.html."
"Nirvana Energy Systems (NES) has pioneered and is commercializing an innovative ThermoAcoustic Power Stick (TAPS) partially based on technology developed by Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and NASA.  NES has demonstrated and is building a 1kWe TAPS for use in remote power applications where reliability for 20+ years is of paramount importance.  The novel TAPS technology has no hot moving parts and incorporates well proven, reliable linear motors and alternators in an engine based on the Stirling cycle.  NES has designed, optimized, built and tested all sub-systems for reliability, ease of manufacturing and cost reduction over currently available Stirling engines.  The 1kWe TAPS formed the starting design for scaling down to a ~300 W tunable power thermoacoustic device. The system is insensitive to radioisotope heat degradation, capable of 10+ years continuous operation, inexpensive to manufacture using well established methods, and yields greater than 25% thermal to electrical efficiency all while being designed for a specific power greater than 30 W/kg. The NES Thermoacoustic Radioisotope Generator (TRG) represents the ultimate in remote power devices and is the next step toward reliable dynamic power conversion for space.

The technical objectives of the NES TRG Phase II effort are to produce a prototype TRG convertor, build a test cell, and validate the designed system performance with a minimum of 500 hours of steady state operation.

During this 18 month effort, the TRG design will undergo any final modifications based on NASA review. Test support hardware will be selected and designed. The prototype and test cell will be manufactured to exact specifications. A risk assessment will be conducted for the convertor. Subsystem and materials coupon tests will be conducted. The TRG system will be assembled and tested for a minimum of 500 hours."
"Observations from historical sources are the basis of this monthly gridded sea ice concentration product that begins in 1850. In 1979, these sources give way to a single source: concentration from satellite passive microwave data.

"Abstract ======== The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset includes 3-Color Multispectral Reduced Data Records for the WAC. The 3-Color Map Projected Multispectral RDR (MD3) data set consists of a 3-color map of northern and equatorial latitudes acquired during MESSENGER's Extended Mission, and includes I/F in the 3 filters used for this map. This product has higher spatial resolution than, and complements, an 8-color multispectral map acquired during the primary mission. This product is photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 128 pixels per degree. The map is divided into 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE, SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile is composed of 3 bands corresponding to 3 of the 11 WAC filters. Each tile also contains backplanes describing ancillary information. The subset of 3 of 11 available multispectral filters samples both albedo and spectral slope over MDIS's wavelength range. The fewer colors than in the Primary Mission 8-color product is to balance the higher spatial resolution to manage data volume during acquisition."

"<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">We propose to enhance our existing compact optical communications terminal, initially developed under a NASA Select SBIR program, by adding the capability for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The addition of QKD ensures secure transmission of encryption keys for encrypted communication with unmanned arial systems. This UAS QKD system could also be used to share keys between two ground locations, allowing point-to-point communication with the security of quantum distributed keys without the necessity of a dedicated fiber-optic connection for QKD. Similarly, the system could be adapted for a satellite, allowing key distribution for secure communication over very long distances. Without the need for a physical link this could provide the security of QKD for remote field applications where a physical link is not possible.

"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."

"TL2NH3N_7 is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)/Aura Level 2 Ammonia Nadir Version 7 data product. TES was an instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite and was launched from California on July 15, 2004. Data collection for TES is complete. TES Level 2 data contain retrieved species (or temperature) profiles at the observation targets and the estimated errors. The geolocation, quality, and other data (e.g., surface characteristics for nadir observations) were also provided. L2 modeled spectra were evaluated using radiative transfer modeling algorithms. The process, referred to as retrieval, compared observed spectra to the modeled spectra and iteratively updated the atmospheric parameters. L2 standard product files included information for one molecular species (or temperature) for an entire global survey or special observation run. A global survey consisted of a maximum of 16 consecutive orbits. Each TES Level 2 standard product reported information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines.Nadir observations, which point directly to the surface of the Earth, are different from limb observations, which are pointed at various off-nadir angles into the atmosphere. Nadir and limb observations were added to separate L2 files, and a single ancillary file was composed of data that are common to both nadir and limb files. A Nadir sequence within the TES Global Survey was a fixed number of observations within an orbit for a Global Survey. Prior to April 24, 2005, it consisted of two low resolution scans over the same ground locations. After April 24, 2005, Global Survey data consisted of three low resolution scans. The Nadir standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Nadir observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Nadir observations only used a single set of filter mix. A Global Survey consisted of observations along 16 consecutive orbits at the start of a two day cycle, over which 4,608 retrievals were performed. Each observation was the input for retrievals of species Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs), temperature profiles, surface temperature, and other data parameters with associated pressure levels, precision, total error, vertical resolution, total column density, and other diagnostic quantities. Each TES Level 2 standard product reported information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines. Each Swath object was bounded by the number of observations in a global survey and a predefined set of pressure levels, representing slices through the atmosphere. Each standard product could have had a variable number of observations depending upon the Global Survey configuration and whether averaging was employed. Also, missing or bad retrievals were not reported. Further, observations were occasionally scheduled on non-global survey days. In general they were measurements made for validation purposes or with highly focused science objectives. Those non-global survey measurements were referred to as “special observations.”A Limb sequence within the TES Global Survey was three high-resolution scans over the same limb locations. The Limb standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Limb observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Limb observations used a repeating sequence of filter wheel positions. Special Observations could only be scheduled during the 9 or 10 orbit gaps in the Global Surveys, and were conducted in any of three basic modes: stare, transect, step-and-stare. The mode used depended on the science requirement. Each limb observation Limb 1, Limb 2 and Limb 3, were processed independently. Thus, each limb standard product consisted of three sets where each set consisted of 1,152 observations. For TES, the swath object represented one of these sets"

Daily and monthly averages of L2 profiles and browse images are available. The L3 standard data products were composed of L3 HDF-EOS grid data. A separate product file was produced for each different atmospheric species. TES obtained data in two basic observation modes: Limb or Nadir. The product file may have contained, in separate folders, limb data, nadir data, or both folders may have been present. Specific to L3 processing were the terms Daily and Monthly, which represented the approximate time coverage of the L3 products. However, the input data granules to the L3 process were completed Global Surveys; in other words a Global Survey were not split in relation to time when input to the L3 processes even if they exceed the usual understood meanings of a day or month. More specifically, Daily L3 products represented a single Global Survey (approximately 26 hours) and Monthly L3 products represented Global Surveys that were initiated within that calendar month. The data granules defined for L3 standard products were daily and monthly. Details of the format of this product can be found in the TES Data Products Specifications (DPS)."

Bowman."
"In this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Leiden Measurement Technology, LLC (LMT) will develop a portable microfludic analysis instrument for measurement of inorganic ions present in potable water supplies, thermal control system cooling water, and human waste water. A primary goal of the Phase I effort was to identify and demonstrate the most viable development path to advance current state-of-the-art NASA microfluidic analytical instrument technology into a user-friendly, compact, and automated instrument platform for use on the International Space Station (ISS). In this SBIR Phase II effort, LMT will advance current state-of-the-art technologies by developing a Microchip Capillary Electrophoresis (MCE) system with Capacitively-Coupled Contactless Detection (C4D) for the rapid separation, detection and quantification of inorganic ions specified in NASA Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEG). The specific objectives of this Phase I R&D effort are: 1) Development and fabrication of Phase II Microfluidic Chips with Embedded C4D Electrodes for Water Quality Analysis on the International Space Station; 2) Development and fabrication of a Phase II Lock-In-Measurement C4D; 3) Development and fabrication of Phase II MCE Microcontroller and Power Breakout Board; 4) Development of and fabrication of a Phase II MCE High Voltage Board; 5) Verification and validation and end-to-end instrument integration"
"The Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) from NOAA-19 Level-2 daily product (SBUV2N19L2) contains ozone nadir profile and total column data from retrievals generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm.

"TL2O3N_8 is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)/Aura Level 2 Ozone Nadir Version 8 data product. It consists of information for one molecular species for an entire Global Survey or Special Observation.  TES was an instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite and was launched from California on July 15, 2004. Data collection for TES is complete. TES Level 2 data contain retrieved species (or temperature) profiles at the TES was an instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite and was launched from California on July 15, 2004. Data collection for TES is complete. TES Level 2 data contain retrieved species (or temperature) profiles at the observation targets and the estimated errors. The geolocation, quality, and other data (e.g., surface characteristics for nadir observations) were also provided. L2 modeled spectra were evaluated using radiative transfer modeling algorithms. The process, referred to as retrieval, compared observed spectra to the modeled spectra and iteratively updated the atmospheric parameters. L2 standard product files included information for one molecular species (or temperature) for an entire global survey or special observation run. A global survey consisted of a maximum of 16 consecutive orbits.Nadir observations, which point directly to the surface of the Earth, are different from limb observations, which are pointed at various off-nadir angles into the atmosphere. Nadir and limb observations were added to separate L2 files, and a single ancillary file was composed of data that are common to both nadir and limb files. A Nadir sequence within the TES Global Survey was a fixed number of observations within an orbit for a Global Survey. Prior to April 24, 2005, it consisted of two low resolution scans over the same ground locations. After April 24, 2005, Global Survey data consisted of three low resolution scans. The Nadir standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Nadir observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Nadir observations only used a single set of filter mix. A Global Survey consisted of observations along 16 consecutive orbits at the start of a two day cycle, over which 3,200 retrievals were performed. Each observation was the input for retrievals of species Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs), temperature profiles, surface temperature, and other data parameters with associated pressure levels, precision, total error, vertical resolution, total column density, and other diagnostic quantities. Each TES Level 2 standard product reported information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines. Each Swath object was bounded by the number of observations in a global survey and a predefined set of pressure levels, representing slices through the atmosphere. Each standard product could have had a variable number of observations depending upon the Global Survey configuration and whether averaging was employed. Also, missing or bad retrievals were not reported. Further, observations were occasionally scheduled on non-global survey days. In general they were measurements made for validation purposes or with highly focused science objectives. Those non-global survey measurements were referred to as “special observations.”A Limb sequence within the TES Global Survey was three high-resolution scans over the same limb locations. The Limb standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Limb observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Limb observations used a repeating sequence of filter wheel positions. Special Observations could only be scheduled during the 9 or 10 orbit gaps in the Global Surveys, and were conducted in any of three basic modes: stare, transect, step-and-stare. The mode used depended on the science requirement. Each limb observation Limb 1, Limb 2 and Limb 3,"
"A thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system is a promising energy conversion device that generates the electric power from short wave infrared (SWIR) thermal radiation. However, it's low power throughput and poor conversion efficiency restricts the usage in practical applications.  One solution for resolving these issues is to utilize a metamaterial emitter whose thermal emission band is spectrally matched to the energy conversion band of the TPV cell.   However, typical frequency selective emitters (SE) emit only in a narrow frequency band, limiting the total power throughput of the TPV system.  This proposal thus aims to experimentally investigate wideband metamaterial emitters, whose emission band is spectrally matched and utilizes the entire energy conversion band of the TPV cell.  The innovative aspects of the proposed research are (1) to develop robust electromagnetic numerical simulation capabilities that incorporate experimentally measured material properties as a function of frequency, and device operation temperature into the design of the metamaterial emitter; (2) incorporate novel metal-nitride materials into the metamaterial structure, enabling optical property tunability through stoichiometric control, and wideband, spectrally matched thermal emission; (3) to fabricate and characterize a metamaterial emitter whose thermal emission band is spectrally matched to the energy conversion band of the target TPV cell. By improving not only the overall efficiency of TPV converters, but importantly the total power throughput, this technology will enable more efficient, compact electrical energy sources for a range of applications, which include power sources for rural and remote locations, solar power generation, waste heat recovery, and power sources for deep space exploration."

"Leveraging extensive experience from Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) environmental analysis, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Airspace Re-design projects, as well as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) environmental modeling and decision-aid projects, Metron Aviation develops a software system to enable balanced noise and emissions reductions by integrated Air Traffic Management (ATM)/aircraft systems.  The proposed capability, Emissions and Noise Total Impact REduction (ENTIRE) is innovative in the follow ways:
1.	It spans the spectrum of environmental impacts, encompassing both noise and local air-quality; 
2.	It conjoins both ATM and aircraft-based activities for the management of these impact; and
3.	It provides a tractable algorithmic approach to achieving specific noise and emissions impact reduction goals.
The proposed capability directly supports the next-generation capabilities and environmentally friendly ATM capability sought under Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Subtopic A3.01 ? Next Generation ATM Systems, directly addressing integrated ATM/aircraft systems that reduce noise and emissions.  This software system enables NASA to provide quantitative techniques for finding ATM/aircraft operations that achieve specific combined noise and emissions impact reductions using methods that identify relative contributions of each aspect of ATM and aircraft operations to these reductions. At its core the system will utilize greedy/breedy algorithms with variance in degrees of freedom and comparison of subsequent solutions towards meeting specific impact reduction goals."

"MI3DAENF_2 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level 3 FIRSTLOOK Global Aerosol product in netCDF format covering a day version 2. It contains a statistical summary of column aerosol 555 nanometer optical depth, and a monthly aerosol compositional type frequency histogram. This data product is a global summary of the Level 2 aerosol parameters of interest averaged over a day and reported on a geographic grid, with resolution of 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree. The FIRSTLOOK processing uses the new time dependence of the Atmospheric and Surface Climatology (TASC) from the same month/previous year. The TASC data set now contains snow-ice and ocean surface wind speed values that are updated on a monthly basis. Therefore, these data sets cannot be generated until the end of the month. Products generated are distinguished by the presence of FIRSTLOOK in the file names. The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm."
"Abstract ======== The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset includes the Multispectral Reduced Data Records for the WAC. The Map Projected Multispectral RDR (MDR) data set consists of a global color map of I/F in the 8 filters used for multispectral mapping during the primary mission, photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 64 pixels per degree. The map is divided into 54 segments or 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE, SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile is composed of 8 bands corresponding to 8 of the 11 WAC filters. Each tile also contains backplanes describing ancillary information. The subset of 8 of 11 available multispectral filters was selected on account of limitations in MESSENGER solid-state recorder space, and more or less evenly samples the spectral range of MDIS."
"We have built and tested an optical extinction monitor for the detection of spacecraft cabin particulates. This sensor sensitive to particle sizes ranging from a few nanometer to tens of micrometers in diameter. Designed to utilize commercial off- the-shelf components, the monitor, once calibrated, requires minimal recalibration and only periodic baseline determinations, a process which can be automated as part of the operation of the instrument. It employs no consumables. This monitor employs cavity attenuation phase shift technology and involves the use a light emitting diode coupled to a low-loss optical cavity. The Phase I project  involved a proof-of-principle demonstration that demonstrated a sensitivity of less than 0.1 micrograms per cubic meter.  During the Phase II project, a prototype sensor will be delivered to NASA for the purpose of laboratory and field measurements.  A major goal will be to miniaturize the monitor."

"A highly sensitive 640 x 480-element flash LADAR camera will be developed that is capable of 100-Hz rates with better than 5-cm range precision. The design is based on proven readout integrated circuit (ROIC) designs, shown to have very low noise, high frame rates, and superior range resolution, and proven high gain, low noise avalanche photodiode (APD) array technology, sensitive in the 1.0- to 1.6-micron wavelength range. These technologies are integrated into a robust, compact camera with real-time processing and data transmission.
In Phase I, an existing 128 x 128-element InGaAs linear-mode (Lm) APD 3D flash LADAR camera will be demonstrated. The FPA allows for readout of multiple laser pulse echo amplitude and time-of-arrival data pairs, in windowed regions, at up to 20K frames per second. The demonstration will include either or both of Voxtel's APD technologies: Deschutes APD technologies, characterized by a mean gain of M = 20 and excess noise parameterized by k = 0.2; or Siletz family of APDs (M = 75; k = 0.02). The data measured on the InGaAs Lm-APDs, along with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis developed from measured data, will be used to develop a new 640 x 480-element ROIC that implements the NASA-communicated mission requirements. By completion of Phase I, the LADAR ROIC pixel circuits will be designed and simulated, and the performance of the new design will be documented."
"The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) NASA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo Black-Sky Albedo for DNB (VNP43D66) is produced daily using 16 days of data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The VNP43D product suite is provided in a Climate Modeling Grid (CMG), which covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each VNP43D product contains just one data layer. 

VNP43D54 through VNP43D79 are the albedo products of the VNP43D BRDF/Albedo product suite. Black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values are provided for the nine VIIRS moderate resolution bands (M1 through M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11) along with the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands included in the VNP43MA3 (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43MA3.001) product. In addition to the bands included in VNP43MA3, this product suite includes albedo values for the VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB). The black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a diffuse component and is a function of solar zenith angle. White-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a direct component when the diffuse component is isotropic.

"ML2SO2_NRT is the EOS Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) Near-Real-Time (NRT) product for sulfur dioxide (SO2). This product contains SO2 profiles derived from the 190 and 240 GHz regions. The NRT data are typically available within 3 hours of observation and are broken into files containing about 15 minutes of data. The most recent 7 days of data are available online. Spatial coverage is near-global (-82 degrees to +82 degrees latitude), with each profile spaced 1.5 degrees or ~165 km along the orbit track (roughly 15 orbits per day). The vertical coverage is from 215 to 10 hPa.

The MLS 4.2 NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet Near Real Time data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products.

"It is often difficult to create autonomous robotic capabilities that match what can be achieved via teleoperation. Even though it is mechanically possible for a humanoid robot such as Robonaut 2 to perform complex coordinated tasks such as tying a knot, exchanging objects between end effectors, plugging in connectors, unscrewing a cap, opening a door, or grasping large objects with two hands, our lack of planning algorithms makes it difficult to control these behaviors autonomously. The lack of planning and control algorithms also impedes human-robot interaction as it is difficult for manipulation robots to plan arm trajectories in real-time using active sensing to avoid collisions with humans. This proposal is to develop a suite of planning and control algorithms that will enable NASA robots to perform complex manipulation behaviors in a coordinated way. This work would benefit NASA by making NASA robots more capable and useful during autonomous tasks, by enabling remote supervisors to command more complex tasks, and by enabling NASA robots to operate safely alongside humans during shared tasks."
"Infinity's High Efficiency Advanced Lightweight Fuel Cell (HEAL FC) is an improved version of its current fuel cell technology developed for space applications. The fundamental operation of this Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell is improved over comparable fuel cell technologies, providing simplified system design and longer duration missions. The Non Flow Through (NFT) nature of reactant consumption within the fuel cell stack produces a much higher utilization of reactants. The Advanced Product Water Removal (APWR) embodied within each repeat element of the fuel cell stack allows for the elimination of the water separation devices usually residing in the balance of system. This drives system simplification while increasing overall reliability and reducing system cost. 
The HEAL FC can be operated as a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell for long endurance missions and also as a hydrogen-air fuel cell. This transition from pure oxygen to air can be accomplished dynamically in flight, allowing for reduced mass of the oxygen storage subsystem. This is a critical advantage for UAS flying to and from dense air environments consuming air as the fuel cell oxidant and switching over to pure oxygen when in the dense air region of concern. 
The fuel cell stack improvements to be made as part of this topic are planned to make the fuel cell stack more amenable to Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) by reducing mass and volume. The current configuration of the fuel cell stack was driven by performance only. Now that the NFT and APWR technologies have been proven, the stack hardware itself must be minimized to fit the UAS markets. Costs for this advanced fuel cell system will inherently be reduced through the implementation of mass production design methodology to transform a well-functioning power system for space applications to lower altitude uses."
"The Automated Ply Inspection (API) system autonomously inspects layups created by high speed automated fiber placement (AFP) machines. API comprises a high accuracy line scanner to measure surface topology of as-made layups driven by a precision articulated arm Robot to perform rapid surface scanning of a Layup after tape placement and layup. Key to API is efficient and robust software to read very large volumes of line scan data and analyze, classify and detect key Layup features very rapidly and reliably. The software retains only key features, filtering the raw data by two orders of magnitude to facilitate real-time data processing at high scan rates. Software also compares the location of as-made features (gaps, overlaps, drops and adds)with the NC program (""virtual layup"") to identify and record only those as-made features that are out of tolerance.     API addresses many of NASA's objectives for this topic:   ? Manufacturing for launch vehicles  ? Innovative automated process (AFP)  ? Applies to reliable, large scale PMC structure  ? Applies to Autoclave and OOA AFP methods    API provides a powerful capability to enhance reliability of structures manufactured by AFP by automating a tedious and difficult manual task. In fact, the speed of AFP machines today has advanced such that manual inspection now takes as much time, and often more, than automated layup requires. API can significantly increase total AFP productivity (C-rate) and reduce cost by reducing Inspection time.  Flightware has enlisted the participation of two other small businesses in this program to contribute their experience and expertise as subcontractors for specific tasks. Furthermore we have attracted the interest of larger industry leaders who supply AFP equipment and manufacture AFP Aerospace parts in this program, because they recognize its potential value.      This API program is a manufacturing innovation subject to Executive Order 13329 ""Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing."""
"Commercial aircrew members and frequent flyers face radiation hazards from the effects of cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. During significant solar events, dose rates can exceed safety thresholds. To mitigate the radiation dose rate and total dose hazards, a unique, state-of-the-art system of physics-based models and real-time data characterizing the aviation radiation environment called Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation for Aviation Safety (NAIRAS) is undergoing development. However, validation of the NAIRAS system must occur to provide confidence that accurate nowcasts, and eventually forecasts, can be made for the aviation radiation environment. The Automated Radiation Measurements for Aviation Safety (ARMAS) project will provide that validation in a cost-effective manner. The Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) radiation detector measures the rate and total quantities of absorbed dose and dose equivalent during aircraft flights. These measurements help estimate the biological risk associated with radiation exposure to humans. Up to three flights of TEPC will be flown during the first half of the performance period. The flight regimes are designed to test a range of representative radiation environments. TEPC results will be analyzed in the second half of the performance period and compared with NAIRAS to validate modeled flight profile results."

"Shape Change Technologies (SCT) has pioneered the use of Self-propagating High Temperature Synthesis (SHS) to manufacture open celled, porous TiNi.  Recently, we have been able to demonstrate the shape memory effect  in these foams, which is a unique capability.   Unlike solid, monolithic TiNi, the open-celled foam structure allows for very rapid response times when immersed in fluids, such as hot water or hot air. The SHS process makes net shape components, and so the cost of the tube can be dramatically reduced, and can have features introduced into the end of the tube to allow for simple torque transfer into a structure.  Thus, in developing a foam torque tube using SHS, all of the key obstacles to its incorporation into existing aerostructures can be resolved, while preserving the key benefits of a lightweight, solid-state structure."
"The Coastal Zone Color Scanner Experiment (CZCS) was the first instrument devoted to
the measurement of ocean color and flown on a spacecraft. Although other instruments
flown on other spacecraft had sensed ocean color, their spectral bands, spatial
resolution and dynamic range were optimized for land or meteorological use and had
limited sensitivity in this area, whereas in CZCS, every parameter was optimized for
use over water to the exclusion of any other type of sensing. CZCS had six spectral
bands, four of which were used primarily for ocean color. These were of a 20 nanometer
bandwidth centered at 443, 520, 550, and 670 nm. Band 5 had a 100 nm bandwidth centered
at 750 nm and a dynamic range more suited to land. Band 6 operated in the 10.5 to 12.5
micrometer region and sensed emitted thermal radiance for derivation of equivalent
black body temperature. (This thermal band failed within the first year of the mission,
and so was not used in the global processing effort.) Bands 1-4 were preset to view
water only and saturated when the IFOV was over most types of land surfaces, or clouds."
"We propose to build an electrostatically focused klystron that exploits recent breakthroughs in scandate cathode technology.  We have built cathodes with greater than 100 Amps/cm2 emission.  This project offers an opportunity to test those cathodes in real world devices.  Because of their small size (.050 inch diameter) and low power dissipation (under 1.2 watts), they are ideal for long-range space missions.  Also, their low beam convergence makes electrostatic focusing feasible.  This, in turn, provides a dramatic reduction in amplifier size and mass.  Without magnets, traveling wave tubes and klystrons will be lighter and smaller, a further enhancement for space missions.  Phase I develops cathodes, pierce guns and focusing stacks.  Phase II will see construction of a working klystron or TWT.  Scandate cathodes also provide longer life than conventional cathodes.  Their small size allows amplifiers to reach much higher frequencies, bandwidth, and data rates than current art."
"To detect air fluorescence generated from cosmic rays with energies exceeding 1019 eV, which are rare events that produce small light flashes at the detector, a large-area, high sensitivity UV (300-400 nm), single-photon detector is needed. Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD), proposes to design and develop large-area solid-state photomultipliers (SSPMs) based on wide band-gap materials. As the intrinsic carrier concentration is directly related to the band gap of the material, the thermally generated dark current associated with WBG materials will be much lower than silicon for a sufficiently small defect density in the bulk material.  The proposed WBG SSPMs will have high gain (105-106), low noise (100 times lower than similar size Si based device), fast response (<5ns), high detection efficiency (>50%) and sensitivity to a single photoelectron at wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm. In phase-I efforts we will explore different design options to improve detection efficiency, response time of the GPD structure. Based on improved GPD structures we will design and fabricate 3mm x 3mm WBG SSPMs. Finally, its basic performance will be evaluated and compared to SSPMs from other vendors and PMTs. The Phase-II effort will develop the large-area multi-element devices and the readout for imaging."

"MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the
Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so
that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes
south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing
the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or
groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). These data will improve our
understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and
in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a vital role in the development of validated,
global, interactive Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough
to assist policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the protection of our
environment."
"Future generations of NASA land/aerial robots will be required to operate in the harsh, unpredictable environments of extra-terrestrial bodies including asteroids, planets, and moons. To compensate for the unpredictability of their operating environments and the vast communication distances with Earth these robots must exhibit an extremely high degree of autonomous behavior through highly customized, on-board hardware. One specific problem is autonomous navigation. Robots must be able to autonomously navigate their target environments by processing visual data. Furthermore, the temperature and radiation hazards of outer space introduce a large number of run-time faults into electronic components potentially compromising the autonomous behavior of these robots. However, the human brain, a device composed of billions of noisy devices, can accurately perform highly complex navigational tasks in spite of its noisy constituent devices. We propose to develop customized Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips that draw inspiration from the brain in terms of their fault-tolerant structures and their approach to solving difficult navigational tasks. First, through the use of pairs of stereo vision ASIC chips that merge photoreceptive cells and computational elements we plan to develop a neuromorphic system that allows a robot to learn appropriate actions about its environment from visual data. Second, we will investigate the use of placing biologically-inspired structures composed of faulty devices on CMOS chips to create fault-tolerant, robust computational elements capable of recovering from run-time errors. These approaches will allow robots exploring extra-terrestrial objects to use visual data to learn about and make progressively better decisions about their unknown environments and allow their hardware to recover from unforeseen errors. Both of these approaches act to increase the lifetime operation of future NASA land/aerial robots as they push outwards into the Solar System and beyond."
"The proposed innovation is a methodology for advanced process control and deposition analysis built around using signals generated by beam-component interactions in the Electron Beam Free Form Fabrication (EBF3) system. Based upon our successful Phase I results, hese signals have the potential to be used for many forms of both metrology and process control. While many material properties might be studied by using this interaction, our initial focus is an investigation into beam and sensor characteristics for geometric analysis of the deposition. Signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material, as it is being deposited. This is important, as the ability to monitor a parameter during deposition creates the possibility of controlling that parameter during the deposition process. As a further refinement, the ability to collect and store a spatially resolved pass-by-pass map of the deposition path geometry may have value in on-the-fly adjustments to subsequent build passes. Such mapping would allow working with the layer-by-layer nature of the deposition process to fine tune the deposition geometry. Such spatially resolved, layer-by-layer deposition mapping could also be stored, giving a three dimensional mapping of the as-built deposition path geometry. This could prove valuable for component quality assurance."

"Aquarius Level 3 sea surface salinity (SSS) rain-flagged standard mapped image data contains gridded 1 degree spatial resolution SSS averaged over daily, 7 day, monthly, and seasonal time
scales. This particular data set is the Daily, Ascending rain-flagged rain-flagged sea surface salinity product for version 5.0 of the Aquarius data set. Only retrieved values for Ascending passes have been used to create this product. The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit.  Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath."
"The JPL web page devoted to looking for life on Mars has two images.  The first is an image of a hydrothermal pool at Yellowstone: the kind of place life might begin.  The second is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the Allen Hills 84001 meteorite.  This SEM picture is famous for capturing our imaginations when, in 1996, it was thought to show the first pictures of extraterrestrial life.  Whether these SEM images represent Martian life forms or something else, they stirred intense scientific research and vigorous debate within the astrobiology community, and increased public interest in the search for life on Mars.  When extraterrestrial life is conclusively discovered, it will most likely be shown to the world using an image from an electron microscope.

Why have no electron microscopes flown on planetary missions?  Because existing SEM's are too large, heavy and fragile to withstand spaceflight. The key to reducing the size and weight of a SEM lies in eliminating the high-vacuum pumping system. In the SEM, every time a new sample is introduced the system must be re-evacuated.  The entire pumping system must travel with the SEM.  This pumping system is heavy, fragile and consumes a lot of power.  It is because of the pumping system that no portable SEM exists, much less one that could travel to Mars.

In this proposal, we will eliminate the need for a high-vacuum system in a SEM.  This is accomplished by developing a new electron source that can operate in relatively poor vacuum conditions.  By eliminating the largest, most complex and heavy part of the SEM, this project will develop a truly portable SEM: the Backpack SEM."
"For Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerators(ADR's) for space it is
desirable to have very light weight, small diameter, high current
density superconducting wires that can operate at temperatures in the
10-30 K range.   Magnesium diboride, a light-weight superconductor wire
is the ideal candidate coil material for ADRs in the 10-30 K range.
During the Phase I we will determine how small of wire can be
manufactured, and that coils can be made from the small diameter wires.
This will lead to the development of full size ADR coils in a Phase II effort."
"Development of an advanced lightweight Trace Contaminant Control filter will play a critical role in the viability of life support systems for future space and interplanetary missions.

Serionix has developed proprietary adsorptive coatings which can be applied to both porous and nonporous substrates to yield functional composite media capable of rapid, efficient, adsorption of trace ammonia and formaldehyde. In preliminary testing, this flexible system has exhibited 7 times higher ammonia capacity relative to conventional phosphoric-impregnated activated carbon.

The primary objective of this Phase I effort is to design and demonstrate a lightweight, high performing system for removal of ammonia and formaldehyde from next generation spacecraft and space suits. Systems for both vacuum-swing and single use adsorption will be extensively evaluated. Secondary performance characteristics such as pressure drop, flammability, and gravimetric/volumetric efficiency will be quantified internally while media prototypes will be delivered to NASA for evaluation.

Building off of a successful Phase I demonstration, the focus of Phase II will be to optimize the system and prototype components to yield mass and volume savings for NASA life support systems. Parallel goals include demonstration of full-scale manufacturing capability and commercialization into industrial applications."

"Accurate predictive modeling of certain atmospheric chemical phenomena (i.e. volcano plumes, smog, gas clouds, wildfire smoke, etc.) suffers from a dearth of information, largely due to the fact that the dynamic qualities of the phenomenon evade accurate data collection. In situ measurements are currently made through the use of ground sensors and dropsondes. ?Ground sensors, such as seismometers, tiltmeters, in-ground gas monitors and near-field remote sensings instruments[,]? have limited measurement density and provide only information about atmospheric boundary conditions. Dropsondes can provide measurements over the entire vertical profile, but are limited to sampling over a small time period. In situ measurements can be augmented with satellite-based remote sensing systems, such as ASTER, MODIS, AIRS and OMI, however, satellite-based data suffers from its relatively small spatial density and limited frequency of measurement. A need exists for additional targeted in situ data from volcanic ash clouds, particularly to assess ...particle size distribution, ash cloud height, and ash cloud thickness including spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal variability of ash concentration.

The proposed innovation, the SuperSwift XT, will meet NASA's need to enhance [the] performance and utility of NASA's airborne science fleet by providing a durable, terrain-following UAS that will be adapted for use in harsh environments containing environmental phenomena that impacts societal activity (i.e. volcanic emissions impacting the safety of passenger aviation).

"This data set, ISLSCP II Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) Monthly Albedo, 1986-1990, contains both the original ERBE albedo data at 2.5 degree spatial resolution, and the International Land Surface Climatology Project Initative II (ISLSCP Initiative II) albedo product re-gridded to 1 degree resolution. The goals of the ERBE were (1) to understand the radiation balance between the Sun, Earth, atmosphere, and space and (2) to establish an accurate, long-term baseline data set for detection of climate changes. Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) data are fundamental to the development of realistic climate models and to the understanding of natural and anthropogenic perturbations of the climate system. As part of ERBE, measurements of broadband shortwave radiation reflected from the Earth-atmosphere system were obtained, from which top of atmosphere albedo values were calculated. In addition, values from scenes determined to be free of clouds were analyzed separately and clear-sky albedos were derived. For this study, only the clear-sky albedos are included. The ERBE data sets for ISLSCP Initiative II contain global, top of atmosphere, clear sky albedo data from January 1986 to February 1990."

"This SBIR project is aimed at developing a novel thermometry technology with upconverting phosphors for temperature measurement in NASA's high-enthalpy wind tunnels. Conventional thermographic phosphors require illumination by ultraviolet (UV) light and emit light at visible wavelengths. However, UV excitation is problematic in many large-scale facilities because it demands very expensive UV-quality windows and the UV light can be absorbed and scattered by gas species and particles in the flow path. Upconversion phosphors have been previously developed in our company and the temperature-sensing effect up to around 1000ºC with excellent sensitivity was demonstrated. A major part of this Phase I efforts will be directed towards applying these thermographic phosphors to a surface coating on a model and tested in a wind tunnel environment. The objective is to develop new surface coatings that are aerodynamically smooth, very durable, require near IR excitation and enable surface temperatures in the range of 300 K to 1500 K to be measured."

"With the introduction of low-cost, small, rapidly configurable spacecraft, the need for robust, versatile, readily deployable, and easily ground-testable thermal control technologies becomes ever more critical.  Passive two-phase thermal control technology, that is, heat pipes, defines the current state-of-the-art, yet it is clear that this technology alone will not meet the needs of future spacecraft.  Dramatic improvements in the versatility and effectiveness of heat pipes are possible with a small amount of mechanical pumping assistance.  With the separation of the liquid pumping and heat transfer functions, greater design freedom and system optimization is also afforded.  However, before pump-assisted heat pipes can become a viable alternative, significant improvement in pump lifetime and robustness is needed.  Lynntech proposes to develop a long-life, robust, low-power, high pressure-rise, electrochemically-driven micropump for use in pump-assisted heat pipes."

"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."
"The NAMMA Carbon mOnoxide By Attenuated Laser Transmission (COBALT) dataset includes measurements of the carbon monoxide mixing ratio and derived carbon monoxide mixing ratio profiles in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere using an in-situ laser absorption spectrometer. These data files were generated during support of the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (NAMMA) campaign, a field research investigation sponsored by the Science Mission Directorate of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This mission was based in the Cape Verde Islands, 350 miles off the coast of Senegal in west Africa. Commencing in August 2006, NASA scientists employed surface observation networks and aircraft to characterize the evolution and structure of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and Mesoscale Convective Systems over continental western Africa, and their associated impacts on regional water and energy budgets."
"One-class nu-Support Vector machine (SVMs) learning technique maps the 
input data into a much higher dimensional space and then uses a small 
portion of the training data (support vectors) to parametrize the 
decision surface that can linearly separate nu fraction of training 
points (labeled as anomalies) from the rest. The exact solution of 
standard one-class nu SVMs assigns (at least) nu fraction of training 
points as support vectors. However some of these support vectors may be 
unnecessary or redundant. Hence the computational issue turns alarming 
especially when SVMs based novelty detectors with nonlinear kernels are 
trained on data sets of huge size. The proposed nu-Anomica algorithm can 
solve this problem. The idea is to train the machine such that it can 
provide a close approximation to the exact decision plane using far less 
number of training points and without loosing much of the generalization 
performance of the classical approach. The developed procedure closely 
preserves the accuracy of standard One-class nu-SVMs while reducing both 
training time and test time by several factors."
"These charts, created by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), provide observed and inferred sea ice extent for each summer month from 1893 to 1956. From 1893 to 1956, the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) created charts of observed and inferred sea ice extent for each summer month. These charts are based on compiled observations of ice conditions reported by a variable network of national organizations, shore-based observers, scientific expeditions, and ships as detailed in each report; in cases where no observations were available, the lead mapmakers extrapolated further ice cover using their knowledge of ice movement. Except for where direct observations are indicated, caution is advised in using the charts’ ice edge because there is no way to quantify the assumptions used in extrapolating ice edge or the error involved in this method. See the note on reliability for further discussion of potential error. The charts were scanned at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) and are being made available here as a service and in cooperation with DMI and other contributors. In all, there are 266 image files containing 291 images."
"<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, which are the heart of emerging aviation autonomous systems and autonomy technologies, are generally perceived as black boxes whose decisions are a result of complex rules learned on-the-fly. Unless the decisions are explained in a human understandable form, the human end-users are less likely to accept them, and in the case of aviation applications, certification personnel are less likely to clear systems with increasing levels of autonomy for field operation. Explainable AI (XAI) are AI algorithms whose actions can be easily understood by humans. This SBIR develops EXplained Process and Logic of Artificial INtelligence Decisions (EXPLAIND), which is a prototype tool for verification and validation of AI-based aviation systems. The SBIR develops an innovative technique called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) for making the learning in AI algorithms more explainable to human users. LIME generates an explanation of an AI algorithm&rsquo;s decisions by approximating the underlying model in the vicinity of a prediction by an interpretable one. We apply LIME to a NASA-developed aircraft trajectory anomaly detection AI algorithm (MKAD) to provide a proof-of-concept. EXPLAIND represents an important step towards user acceptance and certification of multiple AI based decision support tools (DSTs) and flight-deck capabilities planned to be developed under NASA&rsquo;s System Wide Safety and ATM-eXploration projects. EXPLAIND also benefits NASA&rsquo;s planned human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations of machine learning (ML) algorithms using the SMARTNAS Testbed by providing techniques for making the algorithm&rsquo;s decisions more understandable to HITL participants. Moreover, with new European Union regulations soon requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, the EXPLAIND approach is also relevant to multiple non-aviation fields such as medical diagnosis, financial systems, computer law, and autonomous cars.</p>"
"MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the
Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so
that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes
south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing
the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or
groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). These data will improve our
understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and
in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a vital role in the development of validated,
global, interactive Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough
to assist policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the protection of our
environment."
"<p>Under PIDDP, NSF, and internal funding, we have developed an instrument to search for evidence of past life on Mars, to reveal the history of habitability, and to ascertain how the local geology evolved. To validate our dating method, we developed and successfully demonstrated 1st and 2nd generation instruments (one bench-top, and one portable), and successfully produced custom, miniature, solid-state, discrete optics laser systems for desorption, and resonance of Rb and Sr. However, recent advances in fiber laser design allow us to produce resonance laser systems with 0.5X the input power, 4X more output power, 3X lower mass, and 10X fewer optical interfaces; reducing the number of optical interfaces is crucial to reducing alignment and contamination requirements. This proposal seeks to implement and test the fiber laser technology, raising its TRL from 4 to 6.</p>"

"In the Phase I effort, Busek developed a miniature precision piezo-actuated microvalve weighing 32g and occupying 4.5 cm^3.  The valve demonstrated continuous flow regulation of 0-12 sccm nitrogen (15psi supply pressure) thru 0-500 sccm nitrogen (1000psi supply pressure), with a leak rate of better than 1.0 x 10^-5 mbar-l/s.  The simple, low part-count design was developed with a critical eye toward low-rejection rate manufacturability, with several sensitive assembly operations successfully advanced toward, robust, reliable processes.  Resilience under aggressive shock loading, which exhibited negligible effects upon valve operation, was demonstrated.

For the Phase II effort, Busek shall continue refining critical assembly processes to improve reliability in assembly, eliminating remaining elastomers in order to achieve an all-metal architecture.  Additionally, a supplementary feature for downstream volume compensation (for regulation of incompressible liquids affected by induced flows due to mechanism actuation and/or liquid thermal expansion; a necessary feature for colloid thruster operation) shall be developed.  Supporting the colloid application shall be valve driver electronics able to float at thruster beam Voltage.  The design shall be validated via vibration and thermovac testing, and culminate in operation of both a gas-based thruster, as well as a colloid thruster to validate the volume compensation feature."
"This dataset provides water depths and water surface elevations collected during bathymetric surveys of the main channel of the Wax Lake Delta within the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) floodplain of coastal Louisiana, USA. The measurements were made during the Pre-Delta-X Campaign in Fall 2016. The in situ continuous (1 Hz) surveys of channel bathymetry were conducted using a SonarMite Hydrolite Single Beam Echo Sounder mounted on the side of the research boat. The sounder was located directly beneath the Septentrio global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antenna, about 30 cm below the water surface. The sounder depth observations were integrated with the GNSS location and elevation data into one data file per day for October 16-20. These bathymetry measurements were used to generate a merged digital elevation model (DEM) through interpolation with ancillary DEMs to expand the existing wetland DEM to include channels. The merged DEM product is distributed in GeoTIFF format."

"This data set consists of 48-second calibrated, averaged wave electric field intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Saturnian magnetosphere. For each 48-second interval, a geometric average field strength is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kilo- Hertz and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency, four channels per decade. The time associated with each set of averages is the beginning of the averating interval. Averages are stored in units of volt/meter. During data gaps where complete 48-second intervals are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way. Additional information about this dataset and the instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be found in Scarf et al. [1982] and a complete instrument description can be found in Scarf and Gurnett [1977]."

"This project will develop geotechnical measurements, sample extraction and transport equipment for subsurface regolith on NEOs, asteroids, moons and planets, enabling accurate evaluation of subsurface composition and chemistry.  Non-contact measurements can provide preliminary information regarding bulk density and composition; however, more accurate assessment of a bodies' composition and evaluation of potential resources, their abundance and ease of recovery will require physical contact with the surface, and penetration or drilling down to depths that are not subjected to significant space weathering. Such surface-contact and sampling probes will enable physical and chemical characterization of unweathered subsurface material. Inertial and autonomous percussive penetration to depth, along with novel drilling and tailings-transfer approaches, will be developed to both attain the required depth, and to advance semi-autonomous sample-collection/recovery technology so as to minimize the need for operator (or tele-operator) involvement.  Both core- and bulk-regolith sampling methods which minimize loss of volatiles, will be developed. To the extent feasible in the laboratory, this project will approximate key features of reduced-gravity conditions both physically and in particle-scale numerical simulations to ensure that the methods developed will function in realistic environments. The primary aim of this study will be advancement of technologies suitable for use on robotic precursor characterization-missions, with the anticipation that further-improved versions of the same methods will minimize the time and effort of human intervention/involvement during follow-on exploration or prospecting missions. In addition, the feasibility of novel extraction, transport, handling, and storage methods for bulk regolith material, which minimize loss of volatiles, will be developed. Such developments will be especially useful for in-situ resource evaluation and utilization."
"The Level-1A Product file, ""1A01"", is a concatenation of Header record, Spacecraft Attitude packets, VIRS Housekeeping Data packets, VIRS Science Data packets, QACs, and an MDUL.
As such, it is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan, and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as ""sensor counts"". A Level 1A file contains data for a single orbit and has a file size of about 31 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of VIRS 1A01 data produced per day.

The Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) is a five-channel visible/infrared radiometer, which builds on the heritage of theAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument flown aboard the NOAA series of Polar-Orbiting Operational EnvironmentalSatellites (POES). The VIRS detects radiation at 1 visible, 2 near infrared and 2 thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing determination of cloud coverage, cloud top height and temperature, and precipitation indices. The central wavelengths for the VIRS channels are 0.63, 1.60,3.75, 10.8, and 12.0 microns. All channels are in operation during the daytime, but only channels 3, 4 and 5 operate during the nighttime.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation."
We propose the development of a novel aerodynamic modeling approach making use of fully unstructured grids for unsteady panel aerodynamic models for aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic analysis.  The unsteady aerodynamic code will be integrated with an existing suite of aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic analysis tools making it possible to perform aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic analysis of complex vehicles with a significant reduction in user effort and improvement in fidelity.
"Conventional PPM laser transmitters, a CW laser followed by a modulator, are inherently inefficient since the data must be carved from the laser's steady output.  95% of the optical power is discarded in a standard telecom RZ format, with another 8x efficiency reduction using a PPM scheme. An alternative is to form the pulse train with a mode-locked laser. However, since the resultant MLL pulse train is periodic, it must produce pulses in every symbol slot, not just once per symbol.  This means that for a 32-ary PPM scheme, the MLL optical efficiency is reduced by a factor of at least 32 by discarding the un-needed pulses.  In both cases, the electro-optic modulator itself induces an additional 60% optical loss, and requires nearly 0.5W of power to drive.  An alternative is to use a low-repetition-rate MLL in combination with a switch fabric to delay each output pulse into the correct PPM slot.  However, the use of photonic integrated circuits (e.g., silicon) is prohibitive due to the high intrinsic loss.  A 100-MHz PPM data rate scheme requires ~5ns pulse delay.  This represents 43-cm propagation in silicon, inducing a power loss over 10 dB.  Adding the loss due to spiraled delay lines, switch junctions, and coupling on/off chip, the aggregate loss of the switch fabric is 18 to 24 dB, representing a significant efficiency loss.  RAM Photonics proposes the development of a qualitatively novel approach to high-efficiency, low-bit-rate laser transmitters compatible with space-borne missions.  Specifically, we propose to develop a laser transmitter that attains highly efficiency optical data generation by (1) generating only one optical pulse per symbol at arbitrary temporal location, (2) eliminating all electro-optic modulators, and (3) exploiting new advances in fiver optic and opto-electronic packaging.  The new transmitter device has low dissipation (< 0.5 W total) and low SWaP footprint, and can operate at arbitrary data rates and generate any symbol formats."
"The MCD43D14 Version 6.1 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) Model Parameter dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each MCD43D product contains just one data layer. Each of the three model parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric) for each of the MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands included in MCD43C1 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43C1.061) are stored in a separate file as MCD43D01 through MCD43D30. 

MCD43D14 is the BRDF volumetric parameter for MODIS band 5. The volumetric parameter, in conjunction with the isotropic and geometric parameters, is used to derive the BRDF/Albedo values for MODIS band 5. 

The MODIS BRDF/Albedo products have achieved stage 3 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) validation.

"ML3DBOH is the EOS Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) daily binned on various vertical grids product for hydroxyl (OH) derived from radiances measured by the THz radiometer. The data version is 5.1. Data coverage is continuous from August 2, 2005 to December 12, 2009 when the THz radiometer was placed in standby mode. After this date OH data were collected for about 30 days in August/September of 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Spatial coverage is near-global (-82 to +82 degrees latitude), with a spatial resolution of 4 degrees latitude by 5 degrees longitude. The recommended useful vertical range is from 31.6 to 0.00316 hPa, and the vertical resolution is about 3. Users of the ML3DBOH data product should read chapter 4 and section 3.19 of the EOS MLS Level 2 Version 5 Quality Document for more information.

Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Cumulative Station Position Product from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate a long-term DORIS position and velocity cumulative solution through a piecewise linear (position+velocity) model to describe the station motions. The cumulative position and velocity solution is obtained from the stacking of the weekly solution files and is then aligned to the current ITRF. The residuals of this stacking are of particular interest since they depict non-linear station motions.

In zoom-in measurement mode, OMI observes 60 ground pixels (13 km x 24 km at nadir) across the swath. Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~60 minutes) and is roughly 215 MB in size. There are approximately 14 orbits per day. OMI performs spatial zoom-in measurements one day per month. For that day, this product also contains UV2 measurements that are rebinned from the spatial zoom-in measurements. The shortname for this OMI Level-1B Product is OML1BRUZ. The lead algorithm scientist for this product is Dr. Marcel Dobber from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institude (KNMI).

The OML1BRUZ files are stored in HDF4 based EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). The radiances for the earth measurements (also referred as signal) and its precision are stored as a 16 bit mantissa and an 8-bit exponent. The signal can be computed using the equation: signal = mantissa x 10^exponent. For the precision, the same exponent is used as for the signal."
"Electronic procedures are currently being used to document the steps in performing medical operations for the Space Shuttle and/or the International Space Station (ISS). Capturing the data electronically makes is easier to manage, modify and query the contents of the procedures. For the ISS, NASA is currently transitioning to electronic procedures based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) standard.  Modeling procedures electronically using XML has a number of benefits.  Procedures can be quickly and effectively searched to determine which procedures are affected by software and hardware changes.  Procedures are more easily shared by other computer-based systems.  And procedure execution aids become possible, such as real time data capture and automatic book marking of the current procedure step.  Such procedure models will be an important component of an integrated Medical Decision Support needed for future exploration missions.  The primary purpose of this project is to continue to research and develop a Procedure Representation Language (PRL) and support tools that will benefit the creation, maintenance, and use of the medical procedures, and to develop them in such a way that new advances can be easily inserted, eventually leading to the Medical Decision Support system."

"This proposal outlines a plan for developing new technology to provide accurate real-time noise prediction for rotorcraft in steady and maneuvering flight.  Main rotor and tail rotor thickness and loading noise, including Blade-Vortex Interaction noise and Tail-Rotor Interaction noise, will be predicted with physics-based methods by enhancing a real-time lifting surface/free-vortex-wake blade aerodynamics module and coupling it to maneuvering flight acoustic prediction software modified for operation in a time-marching flight simulation environment.  Also included will be methods to account for spherical spreading, atmospheric absorption, and ground effect for flat level terrain.  All new software will be designed with the eventual goal of supporting both high fidelity and real-time solutions through a hierarchy of methods.   Phase I will provide the development of proof of concept prototype software demonstrated for both steady and maneuvering flight.  Phase I will also see an evaluation of real-time potential of the various models.  Phase II will provide the development of a fully-functional, noise prediction software module with real-time and high fidelity capability designed for easy coupling with flight simulation software.  Phase II will also see additional enhancements in the areas of acoustic propagation, High Speed Impulsive noise, and engine and transmission noise."

"Multi-band phased array antenna (PAA) can reduce the number of antennas on shipboard platforms while offering significantly improved performance.  In order to steer wideband beams, photonic beamforming techniques must be invoked so that efficient elemental vector summation in the receiving mode or in the transmit mode is independent of frequency. Crystal Research, Inc. proposes to develop a multi-band photonic antenna based on a high-speed optical true-time-delay beamformer, capable of simultaneously steering multiple independent RF beams in less than 300 ns.  Such a high steering speed is 3 orders of magnitude faster than any other existing optical beamformers.  Unlike other approaches, the proposed technology uses a single controlling device per operation band, which eliminates the need for massive optical switches, laser diodes and fiber Bragg gratings. More importantly, only one beamformer is needed for all antenna elements. Advantages of the proposed multi-badn photonic phased array anttena includes wideband multibeam operation, high-speed steering, microwave delay compatible, small size, light weight, low power consumption, and immune to electro-magnetic interfere.  The Phase II technical goal is to extend the Phase I results into a fully functional prototype of a multi-band photonic phased array antenna, which will be delivered to NASA."
"This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Saturnian magnetosphere. For each 4-second interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency, four channels per decade. The time associated with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning of the scan. During data gaps where complete 4-second spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way. When one or more channels are missing within a scan, the missing measurements are zero-filled. Data are edited but not calibrated.

"Nanostructured Thin Films (NSTF), used as substrates for catalysts, have proven to be highly active for oxygen reduction in fuel cells. This improvement in activity is expected to transfer to electrolyzer technology as the NSTF substrate layer, with a ruthenium oxide based catalyst, is used for oxygen evolution."
"Balcones Technologies, LLC proposes to adapt actively controlled suspension technology developed by The University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics (CEM) for high performance off-road vehicles to address STTR 2009-1 Subtopic T1.02, Information Technologies for Intelligent Planetary Robots.  In particular, our team will develop a concept design for an actively controlled ElectroMechanical Suspension (EMS) system, including algorithms, software and hardware, that dramatically improves mobility for MER to MSL scale rovers.  Our system exploits and adapts approximately $25M of highly successful active suspension R&D at CEM since 1993.  It also exploits CEM's experience developing electromechanical systems for space applications gained during NASA funded programs to develop flywheel energy storage system technology for the International Space Station.  Finally, it exploits our team's extensive experience migrating University technology to commercially viable manufacturable products.  Relevant features of our anticipated solution include:
•	Capable of vehicle speeds exceeding 3 m/s over lunar relevant terrain while maintaining hyper-stability for payloads of 100 kg or more
•	Large suspension travel to enable obstacle negotiation 
•	Control system that can operate autonomously or slaved to higher level vehicle controller for specialized operations such as obstacle negotiation
•	Four quadrant actuator control, capable of power regeneration for damping operations to improve system efficiency
•	Passive springs to support rover static weight (no power consumption to support static weight)
•	Highly efficient electromechanical suspension actuators for each wheel station,  individually sized to support a high proportion of vehicle mass to enable obstacle negotiation
•	Modular control system, based on our highly successful control system for terrestrial manned and unmanned vehicles
•	Scalable technology for rover sizes representative of MER to MSL rovers"
"The MODIS/Aqua Cloud Mask and Spectral Test Results 5-Min L2 Swath 250m and 1km product consists of global cloud mask quality assurance and other ancillary parameters. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality.  The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MYD35_L2.

The MYD35_L2 product files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). This product consists of 9 parameters and each of these parameters are stored as a Scientific Data Set (SDS) within the HDF-EOS file. The Cloud Mask and Quality Assurance SDS's are stored at 1 kilometer pixel resolution. All other SDS's (those relating to time, geolocation, and viewing geometry) are stored at 5 kilometer pixel resolution.

"This data set, as part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Program, combines interferometric phases from multiple satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar systems to derive the first comprehensive phase-based map of Antarctic ice velocity. The precision in ice speed and flow direction over 80% of Antarctica is better than prior mappings based on feature and speckle tracking by a factor of 10. Phase-derived velocity mostly covers the years between 2007 and 2018, while tracking-derived velocity (for regions along the coasts) is mostly found in the years from 2013 to 2017. Additional data acquired between 1996 and 2018 were used as needed to maximize coverage.

"Scandate cathodes are proposed as a way to boost performance and life for electric space propulsion systems.  This company has recently demonstrated breakthrough performance on these cathodes in other formats.  We have demonstrated emission of 5 Amps/cm2 at 850 degrees CB, which is 200 degrees C below that of conventional cathodes.  At this temperature they should live at least 100,000 hours.  This makes scandate cathodes a candidate for use in deep space missions.  
In Phase I we propose construction and testing of several hollow scandate cathodes.  We propose to do both vacuum and ion environment characterization on them.  In Phase II we will begin active collaboration with NASA to test these cathodes in complete ion thrusters."
"The proposed Phase I program would develop and prototype a high frequency, high performance reflective mesh that is well suited to the emerging small aperture antenna designs.  The program will review heritage mesh architectures and trade them against new designs.  New materials and manufacturing methods will be evaluated with the goal of making low-cost mesh for CubeSat missions.  The mesh samples will be tested to determine their mechanical stiffness properties.  RF test samples will be delivered to NASA JPL."

"This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Clock Product Summary from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure.  Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS satellite and ground receiver clock values. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS final combined satellite and receiver clock products. The final products are considered the most consistent and highest quality IGS solutions; they consist of daily orbit files, generated on a weekly basis with a delay up to 13 (for the last day of the week) to 20 (for the first day of the week) days. All satellite and receiver clock solution files utilize the clock RINEX format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC. The solution summary file details information about the generation of the final combined clock products and comparison with the individual AC solutions."
"The future of the NASA space program includes longer and more invasive missions into space, with a goal to return to the moon's surface by the year 2015.  Long duration storage of large quantities of cryogenic fluids for propulsion, power, and life-support is an essential requirement for these missions.  The behavior of active and passive cryogenic management is paramount to the thermal status of a spaceship and cryotanks storage.  Efficient and reliable insulation materials are key to the success of long missions into space.  Aspen Aerogels proposes to develop a durable and cost effective hybrid aerogel/MLI insulation system for cryogenic storage in space applications.  The proposed hybrid insulation system will withstand micrometeoroids impacts and will outperform the MLI in cases of vacuum loss.  During the Phase II Program, extensive work will be dedicated to the developing a system level solution for installation of the flexible hybrid insulation system onto cryotank surfaces to minimize seams, and thermal leaks.  Development of the proposed novel cost effective insulation package will provide NASA with a long-term cryogenic propellant storage thermal control solution for applications in low earth orbit (LEO), and on the lunar surface."

"The MODIS/Terra Aerosol, Cloud and Water Vapor Subset 5-Min L2 Swath 5km and 10km (MODATML2) product contains a combination of key high interest science parameters. The ATML2 product provides a subset of datasets from the suite of atmosphere team products on both a 10 km scale (aerosols) and 5km scale (native 5 km cloud properties and a 5x5 pixel sample of the 1km cloud datasets). The ATML2 product employs the same 5x5 pixel sampling scheme for the 1km native resolution Level 2 products as is used in the MOD08 Level 3 global aggregated product, an approach that has been shown to retain statistical integrity for multi-day aggregations. 

The C6 significantly increases the number of datasets included in the ATML2 product, including the full suite of QA datasets. Since the ATML2 data granule file size is significantly smaller than the combined size of the individual L2 products, and because the 1 km pixel sampling is consistent with the L3 algorithm, the ATML2 product is a more practical means for the user community to develop research L3 algorithms for their own specific purposes.

"Thermal management is one of the most important challenges in space applications. The success of space exploration and travel is directly tied to how we efficiently convert, transfer, and store energy in energy systems such as maintaining cryogenic fluids for propulsion, protection of vehicles from aerodynamic heating, and maintaining comfortable living conditions for crew. This energy transfer takes the form of heat acquisition, heat transport, and heat rejection. An effective thermal control system must provide these three basic functions while being mindful of the operational environment and spacecraft system. At the heart of this energy conversion is interfacial heat transfer especially that between solids and liquids/gases, which can be significantly enhanced using nanotechnology-enabled functionalized surfaces.

Functionalized surfaces with tailored thermal and wettability properties can be fabricated using Femtosecond Laser Surface Processing (FLSP); engineered surface properties are obtained by the production of self-organized microstructures covered by layers of nanoparticles. Preliminary results using such surfaces have displayed very promising heat transfer properties with extraordinary shifts of the Leidenfrost temperature and enhancement of both the pool boiling heat transfer coefficients and critical heat flux. The observed extraordinary heat transfer is attributed to both the microstructure and the presence of self-assembled nanoparticles on top of the microstructures, through the collective contributions of effective thermal conductivity, high liquid wetting and capillary wicking, high nucleation site density, and the formation of nanobubbles from three-dimensional nanocavities.

Understanding the fundamental causes of augmented heat transfer in FSLP fabricated multiscale metallic micro/nano structured surfaces is expected to foster breakthrough applications in energy conversion and storage. Knowledge acquired from the proposed research can be used in the design of more compact and efficient heat exchangers and cold plates used in space applications, thus dramatically reducing the hardware mass and volume. In addition, the FSLP technique does not use any coatings or thin film depositions as the microstructures and nanoparticles are created from the base metallic material. This technique can therefore have significant advantages in permanency over organic coatings in high temperature conditions found in space applications. The research objective of this proposal is to experimentally investigate the interfacial two-phase transfer mechanisms of pool boiling and flow boiling heat transfer on FSLP multiscale functionalized nano/microstructured surfaces."

"TL2PANNS_8 is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)/Aura Level 2 Atmospheric Temperatures Limb Version 8 data product. TES was an instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite and was launched from California on July 15, 2004. Data collection for TES is complete. It consisted of information for one molecular species for an entire Global Survey or Special Observation. TES Level 2 data contained retrieved species (or temperature) profiles at the observation targets and the estimated errors. The geolocation, quality and other data (e.g., surface characteristics for nadir observations) were also provided. L2 modeled spectra were evaluated using radiative transfer modeling algorithms. The process, referred to as retrieval, compared observed spectra to the modeled spectra and iteratively updated the atmospheric parameters. L2 standard product files included information for one molecular species (or temperature) for an entire global survey or special observation run. A global survey consisted of a maximum of 16 consecutive orbits. Nadir and limb observations were in separate L2 files, and a single ancillary file was composed of data that are common to both nadir and limb files. A nadir sequence within the TES Global Survey was a fixed number of observations within an orbit for a Global Survey. Prior to April 24, 2005, it consisted of two low resolution scans over the same ground locations. After April 24, 2005, Global Survey data consisted of three low resolution scans. The Nadir standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Nadir observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Nadir observations only used a single set of filter mix. A Global Survey consists of observations along 16 consecutive orbits at the start of a two day cycle, over which 3,200 retrievals were performed. Each observation was the input for retrievals of species volume mixing ratios (VMRs), temperature profiles, surface temperature and other data parameters with associated pressure levels, precision, total error, vertical resolution, total column density and other diagnostic quantities. Each TES Level 2 standard product reported information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines. Each Swath object wa bounded by the number of observations in a global survey and a predefined set of pressure levels representing slices through the atmosphere. Each standard product could have had a variable number of observations depending upon the Global Survey configuration and whether averaging is employed. Also, missing or bad retrievals were not reported. The organization of data within the Swath object was based on a superset of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) pressure levels that was used to report concentrations of trace atmospheric gases. The reporting grid was the same pressure grid used for modeling. There were 67 reporting levels from 1211.53 hPa, which allowed for very high surface pressure conditions, to 0.1 hPa, about 65 km. In addition, the products reported values directly at the surface when possible or at the observed cloud top level. Thus in the Standard Product files each observation could potentially contain estimates for the concentration of a particular molecule at 67 different pressure levels within the atmosphere. However, for most retrieved profiles, the highest pressure levels were not observed due to a surface at lower pressure or cloud obscuration. For pressure levels corresponding to altitudes below the cloud top or surface, where measurements were not possible, a fill value was applied.To minimize the duplication of information between the individual species standard products, data fields common to each species (such as spacecraft coordinates, emissivity, and other data fields) have been collected into a separate standard product, termed the TES L2 Ancillary Data product (ESDT short name: TL2ANC).

"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."
"This work directly addresses a technology of interest listed in Section 9, sub-section H1.01 In-Situ Resource Utilization, specifically ""Highly efficient reactors for carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide (CO/CO2) conversion into methane (CH4).""

The proposal will investigate combining recent work that demonstrates outstanding CO2 sorption by third generation ionic liquids (ILs) without an increase in viscosity (even in the presence of water) with adaptations of recently developed methodology for electrochemically reducing and polymerizing CO2 in an aqueous IL to polyethylene. The intention is to demonstrate that this methodology is an excellent candidate for creating a highly efficient reactor for carbon dioxide conversion to methane. Unlike conventional electrolytes, ILs generally have very low vapor pressures.  This will make it possible for them to be used in the much lower pressure Martian atmosphere without the problem of evaporation.

Our goal is to build on the results achieved by other research groups by using our own knowledge and years of experience working with ILs, including electrochemistry, to efficiently reduce CO2.  We will prepare the task-specific 3rd generation ILs and then measure their electrochemical properties; i.e., conductivity, electrochemical window, etc.  These are currently unknown but are important in order to ascertain whether these ILs are suitable for this application.   Anticipating this will be the case, we will then test various electrodes, including TiO2 and silver cathodes, to determine which gives the most selective reduction of CO2 to methane.  The efficiency of the process (including power requirements) will be quantified and compared to the Sebatier and Fischer-Tropsch processes."
"This dataset contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah 3.6.1 model in the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS).  The data are in 0.10 degree resolution and range from January 1982 to present. The temporal resolution is monthly and the spatial coverage is global (60S, 180W, 90N, 180E).  The FLDAS regional monthly datasets will no longer be available and have been superseded by the global monthly dataset. 

The simulation was forced by a combination of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) 6-hourly rainfall data that has been downscaled using the NASA Land Data Toolkit.

The simulation was initialized on January 1, 1982 using soil moisture and other state fields from a FLDAS/Noah model climatology for that day of the year.

Since the values in the data sets do not represent the fluxes over open water, a water body mask needs to be applied to set the data values over inland water to null. The MOD44W MODIS Water Mask is the standard land/sea mask for FLDAS, and is available for download through the LDAS project home page."
"During 2008-2009, we completed development and alpha-testing (debugging) of a depression treatment computer program. The program uses video, audio, graphics, and text to guide users through the steps of problem-solving treatment, and evidence-based treatment for depression. Users are guided through the treatment by Dr. Mark Hegel, a national expert in the intervention, who is presented via video and audio. The user's experience is tailored to his or her responses to questions, progress in the treatment, and depression level. Dr. Hegel asks questions and users respond via free text and menus. Each of the program's six sessions involves six steps. The efficacy of problem-solving treatment has been well-established in clinical settings, so our research questions were whether a computer program could be developed to deliver the intervention, and how efficacious it would be. If such a program could be built and is effective, it would be possible to provide a validated intervention to astronauts on long-duration missions who require treatment for depression.    
After completing development and alpha-testing, we conducted a pilot study to obtain an initial estimate of the program's efficacy. A randomized clinical trial was conducted with a small number of participants (N=14), of which 10 were female, 2 were Latino/Hispanic, and 1 was African American. The mean age was 50.5 years and all had completed at least 4 years of college, making them somewhat analogous to the astronaut population. Half of the participants were assigned to use the depression treatment program for 6 sessions, with a 1-week and 1-month follow-up. The other half were assigned to a wait-list control condition and re-evaluated after 7 weeks. (Note that not receiving a behavioral intervention is likely to be typical for astronauts with depression on long-duration missions, making the wait list a ""treatment as usual"" condition.) One of the control group participants dropped out of the study and 2 of the experimental group participants' data were omitted due to excessive lapses of time between sessions 3 and 4.    
The primary outcome was the Hamilton Depression Inventory, a standard measure of depression. No differences were found between groups at pre-test, and the mean for both groups was in the mild range of depression. A comparison of percent change from pre-test to post-test was made for the experimental (treatment) group and the control group. A significant difference (p<.045) was found between groups, with the experimental group improving more. The effect size was large (Cohen's d = 1.73). These results suggest that the depression treatment program may be efficacious for treating minor depression; however, a larger-sample clinical trial is required to confirm them."
"The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team. 

Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.

This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the final estimate of the Daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHH and giving the result in (mm). 

The latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. 

In the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.

The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.

The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.

The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:

""Early"" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and
""Late"" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing
and once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:

""Final"", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.

Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide"

"Phase II of the Titan Submarine: Exploring the Kraken Mare effort will focus on advancing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the concept by (1) retiring risks found in the Phase I design, (2) gathering new Kraken Sea observations by Cassini, and (3) further defining science goals and instruments to fulfill them; each of these tasks will feed into two COMPASS design sessions. All of these products should ready the Titan Submarine (Titan Sub) concept to a confidence level that allow further NASA investment. The major risks found in the Phase I conceptual design center around vehicle operations in a liquid hydrocarbon sea. Basic physics questions of operating in this cryogen need to be answered. Cryogenic experts at the NASA Glenn Research Center will develop models to explore mixtures and pressures of cryogens and gases and how they would react with a warm submarine. Results from these models will be used to refine the ballast and propulsion system conceptual designs as well as feed into development of a hydrodynamic fluid models at the Pennsylvania State University Applied Research Laboratory for evaluating the conceptual design. Cassini continues to observe both the constituents (remotely) and the depth of the northern Titan Seas. Up-to-date data will be gathered and used as inputs for the modeling mentioned above. These data, along with the above analysis results, will be used to refine the science goals, concept of operations, and instrument suite for the Titan Sub. These activities will be led by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The Phase II efforts will be strengthened by workshops at selected science and cryogenic conferences that will include scientists, cryogenic engineers (including the liquid natural gas industry) respectively, as well as NASA project planners to review the Titan Sub concept and add direction and experience to the challenges it faces. The results of both the above efforts will feed into a COMPASS current engineering design run to update the current Titan Sub conceptual design to mature the concept. Launch and delivery options will be explored (in Phase I funds were not sufficient to design more than the Sub itself) on how to deliver this long cylindrical submarine. Risks of an exposed phased-array antenna to communicate directly back to Earth will also be explored. A second COMPASS run will develop a Titan Sub that would be delivered as part of an orbiter system. The presence of an orbiter would greatly simplify several aspects of the submarine design, especially delivery and communications."
"THIRN5L1CH67 is the Nimbus-5 Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR) Level 1 Meteorological Radiation Data at 6.7 microns product and contains radiances expressed in units of equivalent brightness temperature measured in the 6.7 micron channel. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from magnetic tapes, also referred to as Nimbus Meteorological Radiation Tapes (NMRT-THIR). The data are archived in their original IBM 36-bit word proprietary format, also referred to as a binary TAP file.

The Nimbus-5 satellite was successfully launched on December 11, 1972. The THIR experiment on Nimbus-5 continued the measurements made by its predecessor flown on Nimbus-4. The THIR instrument is a two channel high resolution scanning radiometer designed to perform two major functions:* 11.5 micron channel provides both day and night cloud top or surface temperatures. The ground resolution at the sub-point is 8 km and operates day and night.* 6.7 micron channel gives information on the moisture content of the upper troposphere and stratosphere and the location of jet streams and frontal systems. The water vapor channel has a resolution of the sub-point is 22 km and operates mostly at night.

The THIR Principal Investigator was Andrew W. McCulloch from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The Nimbus-5 THIR data are available from December 19, 1972 (day of year 354) through August 26, 1974 (day of year 238). The THIRN5L1CH115 product contains the 11.5 micron channel data.

This product was previously available from the NSSDC with the identifier ESAD-00167 (old ID 72-097A-08D)."
"Interest is rapidly growing in eye-safe solid-state lasers for range finding, LIDAR, infrared countermeasures, medicine, dentistry, and others. To address the need for compact, high efficiency lasers operating in this important spectral band, an ultra-compact turnkey, narrow-band, high-mode-quality, high-pulse-energy, and high-pulse-repetition-frequency (PRF), diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) pulsed laser system will be developed that, due to superior near infrared (NIR) absorption characteristics, high phonon energies, and good thermal characteristics, can be used in an optically thin configuration, which, when properly designed, including using a directly-mounted thermally conductive index matched window, allows for very high average power in the 1500 &#150; 1600-nm spectral band. The laser is based on a new material system. The new innovative laser will be shown to best satisfy NASA remote sensing, mapping, and navigation and hazard avoidance applications by offering 0.2 mJ &#150; 2 mJ (1550 nm) at pulse rates from 10 Hz to 100 KHz.
In Phase I, existing analytical laser models will be updated, integrated with optical models, and a candidate laser design will be developed. The new laser material will then be configured in end-pumped passive- and actively-Q-switched laser designs, and the laser output as a function of pump power, pump energy, and pump repetition rate will be characterized."

"MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature/3-Band Emissivity 8-Day L3 Global 1km SIN Grid (MOD21A2.006).

A new suite of MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Emissivity products are available in Collection 6. The MOD21 LST algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MOD11 LST products, in that the MOD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MOD11 uses the split-window technique. The MOD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to retrieve dynamically both the LST and Emissivity simultaneously from the three MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions.

The MOD21A2 dataset is an 8-day composite LST product that uses an algorithm based on a simple-averaging method. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud free MOD21A1D and MOD21A1N daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the MOD21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the MOD21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate science dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The LST, Quality Control (QC), View zenith angle, and Viewing time have separate day and night SDS layers, while the values for the MODIS emissivity bands 29, 31, and 32 are the average of both the nighttime and daytime acquisitions. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/mod21_atbd.pdf).

Notification 

The Terra MODIS LST product suite (MOD21) for the 2000 through 2005 time period are being released to the public with a provisional maturity status, as these products may have been negatively impacted by an optical crosstalk issue in the IR bands (B27 - B30). Although the crosstalk issue was present from the beginning of the mission, the impact on the product is not significant until after 2005. Thus, the Terra LST products are not being produced beyond 2005. The Aqua MODIS data are not affected by this crosstalk issue and the MYD21 LST products are considered to be science quality data with a stage 1 validation status. Additional information is available on the MODIS Land Quality Assessment website (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD21&caseNum=PM_MOD21_18283&caseLocation=cases_data&type=C6)."

"<p>The opportunity exists for flying and operating a geostationary gravitational wave interferometer that relies on three communication satellites (comsats). Since current drag-free designs can&#39;t provide the level of &ldquo;free-fall&quot; onboard these spacecraft because of their large size and mass, in collaboration with Stanford University we have developed a novel drag-free system that operates without the need of micro-newton (mN) thrusters. The proposed system could also be used onboard suitably designed spacecraft for future planned gravitational wave missions or for other space-based precision gravity experiments.</p> <p>Given the large volume and additional mass available for scientific use on planned commercial geostationary platforms, we have conceived an alternative drag-free design, which we have named &ldquo;Two-Stage Drag-free&rdquo;. It can be regarded as a modification of the Modular Gravitational Reference Sensor (MGRS) design developed at Stanford University during the past decade.&nbsp; Our two-stage drag-free system works in the following way. A rigid structure containing the MGRS is free-floating within the enclosure cap added to a comsat nadir deck. The free-floating spherical proof mass location, relative to the rigid structure hosting it, is measured through laser metrology; the position of the rigid structure within the enclosing cap is measured instead by a network of sensors. The sensors data is passed on to a set of cold-gas thrusters that act on the comsat to maintain its position relative to the rigid structure to within a few centimeters, while at the same time both measurements are used by a set of actuators that constantly maintain the rigid structure centered on the spherical proof mass. In our two-stage drag-free design the actuators rely on the comsat mass to react against in order to center the rigid structure on the proof-mass, thereby performing the equivalent operation of the &mu;N thrusters in the traditional drag-free design.</p>"
"Physical Sciences Inc. and Purdue University propose to develop a novel approach to scavenging heat from high intensity thermal environments encountered during space missions and converting this thermal power to electrical power at high efficiency.  Examples include extremely hot heat shields during vehicle entry into planetary atmospheres (Mars/Venus probes) and during high speed ascent through planetary atmospheres (Sample return from Mars/Venus), hot claddings of radioisotope thermoelectric generators used for powering outer planetary spacecraft and multi-decade planetary bases (Mars/Venus/Lunar), as well as combustors and nozzles of space and launch propulsion systems. In this STTR we will develop an integrated metal hydride system and spectrally-tuned thermophotovoltaic power converter system that can extract heat during periods of high thermal intensity (tens of seconds), and convert it to electricity at greater than 25 percent efficiency. Following the end of this period, the system can continue to generate useful power for additional tens of minutes.

In Phase I, for the power converter system, we will demonstrate feasibility of fabricating a critical component in larger areas (5 cm x 5 cm), and for the metal hydride (MH) system, we will experimentally characterize the MH decomposition/recombination reactions that enable continual electrical power generation for a useful duration after the period of high thermal intensity has ended.  In Phase II, we will produce an engineering prototype of the integrated heat scavenging electrical power generator system, fully tested in laboratory environment and in simulated operational thermal environment, together with an analytical model of a functional system."

"LMOS_Ground_WDNRRoutine_Data_1 is the Lake Michigan Ozone Study (LMOS) ground site data collected at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) Routine ground site during the LMOS field campaign. This product is a result of a joint effort across multiple agencies, including NASA, NOAA, the EPA, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), National Science Foundation (NSF), Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) and its member states, and several research groups at universities. Data collection for this product is complete.Elevated spring and summertime ozone levels remain a challenge along the coast of Lake Michigan, with a number of monitors exceeding the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. The production of ozone over Lake Michigan, combined with onshore daytime “lake breeze” airflow is believed to increase ozone concentrations at locations within a few kilometers of the shore. This observed lake-shore gradient motivated the Lake Michigan Ozone Study (LMOS). Conducted from May through June 2017, the goal of LMOS was to better understand ozone formation and transport around Lake Michigan; in particular, why ozone concentrations are generally highest along the lakeshore and drop off sharply inland and why ozone concentrations peak in rural areas far from major emission sources. LMOS was a collaborative, multi-agency field study that provided extensive observational air quality and meteorology datasets through a combination of airborne, ship, mobile laboratories, and fixed ground-based observational platforms. Chemical transport models (CTMs) and meteorological forecast tools assisted in planning for day-to-day measurement strategies. The long term goals of the LMOS field study were to improve modeled ozone forecasts for this region, better understand ozone formation and transport around Lake Michigan, provide a better understanding of the lakeshore gradient in ozone concentrations (which could influence how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) addresses future regional ozone issues), and provide improved knowledge of how emissions influence ozone formation in the region."
"<p>Readiness of the fabrication method is needed to justify future NASA astrophysics &amp; heliophysics Missions.We propose to develop a novel optics fabrication method capable of fulfilling this demand for high-resolution, large-effective-area, affordable x-ray optics.The intent is to change the optical fabrication philosophy by starting the process with naturally-flat, thin silicon wafers and form them into very-light-weight, sub-arcsecond-resolution mirrors to be installed into a telescope structure</p> <p>The goal of this proposed study is to demonstrate viability of a novel optics fabrication method that would ultimately make high-resolution, very large effective area x-ray optics affordable. The scientific community desires sub-arcsecond angular resolution and few-square-meter-effective-area x-ray optics for future large, and mid size NASA missions. This means that future x-ray telescopes must have the same or better angular resolution and more than order of magnitude larger effective area than the Chandra Observatory, but within manageable cost budgets and mass limits. Since the cost to build the Chandra optics (0.25 arcsecond resolution and 0.08 sq. m. effective area) was $0.5 billion in 1999 prices, the use of the traditional figuring and polishing techniques to fabricate the x-ray optics for future high-resolution, large effective area instruments are cost prohibitive. Thus, the astronomical x-ray optics fabrication philosophy needs to be changed to meet the scientific community expectations. Currently, the conventional approach to building light-weight, low-cost, large-effective-area x-ray optics is to trade off angular resolution for increased mirror area through replication techniques. In these, thin optics are obtained by replication from super-polished and figured masters, then aligned and assembled into a telescope structure. During the replication process, which is done at MSFC via electroforming, small stresses are always imparted in to the shell. Separation of the thin replica from the master leads to releasing of this stress, which then results in unwanted figure deformations of the replica surface. Further, localized forces at the support points introduce additional surface deformations during the replica optics alignment process. As a result, the state-of-the-art performance for replicated optics is currently about 10 arcsecond angular resolution. Another approach to building up effective area for x-ray telescopes is to use so-called pore optics.</p>"
"In order to avoid an unintended failure in proposed Solar Sail spacecraft due to solarelastic interactions it is important to develop an analytical framework for predicting the interaction between the solar pressure and the solar membrane. I will develop a fully coupled membrane, solar pressure model that can be used to predict dynamic instabilities for Solar Sails. Many of the techniques will be directly borrowed from supersonic aeroelastic analysis but the analysis will specifically focus on proposed Solar Sails. Specifically I will couple a solar pressure model proposed by MacNeal [1] with finite element structural model of the Solar Sail to determine the critical dimensions for different solar pressure strengths. Furthermore, I will conduct non-linear structural analysis for the sails to determine the post critical behavior and ensure that the stress induced by flutter will not cause catastrophic sail failure.

In addition I will validate my theoretical model with experimentation. Because the solar pressure will not be measurable on the ground where aerodynamic forces will dominate, alternate methods of simulating the solarelastic response will be developed. For my research I will use piezoelectric patches to simulate the generalized forces in the most important structural modes. The most important structural modes will be determined by the unstable eigenvalues in the solarelastic analysis and the critical mode shape from the corresponding eigenfuctions. As with the theoretical analysis, initial simulations will be done on the simply supported rectangle case.

"<p>Measurements in NASA's wind tunnels generally consist of force and moment and on-body measurements like surface pressure, surface deflection or heat transfer to the surface.  Detailed off-body measurements are needed to understand complex wind tunnel flows and to provide data to validate high-fidelity computational models. Most existing techniques capable of measuring detailed off-body flows, for example, particle image velocimetry, require particle or gas seeding which is not possible in many of NASA's tunnels. In this project, two techniques utilizing new femtosecond laser technology will be investigated. Both techniques show promise of measuring multiple parameters quantitatively in unseeded wind tunnel flows. The femtosecond laser electronic excitation and tagging (FLEET) technique can measure velocity and potentially pressure and temperature simultaneously. The femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (FS-CARS) technique can measure pressure, temperature and species concentrations. The two techniques have relative advantages and limitations that will be explored.  The objective of this research project is to leverage recent advancements in laser technology and recent discoveries in academia to discover and apply new ways of measuring aerospace flows. In particular, methods of measuring the gas velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration will be developed. The two different measurement techniques share a common femtosecond laser technology and can be used separately or together to measure multiple gas properties simultaneously in wind tunnel flows and possibly in flight. In this project, we are extending the ability of FLEET to measure multiple parameters such as pressure and temperature simultaneous with velocity.  These additional parameters will be obtained by observing and interpreting the amplitude and spectrum of the FLEET signal.  The main novelty of the proposed work is that FLEET should allow velocity to be measured in several facilities where velocity cannot be curren</p>"

"This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Ionosphere Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) comparison product (daily files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. GNSS observations from a global network can be utilized for atmospheric measurements. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce independently computed VTEC maps. The IGS Ionosphere Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS VTEC maps. The validation products are used to compare the IGS and AC solutions of generated VTEC maps.

"The MCD43D38 Version 6 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) QA ValidObs Band 6 dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter (m)) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each MCD43D product contains just one data layer. MCD43D38 provides MODIS band 6 valid observation quality information for the MCD43D products. 

MCD43D38 contains the valid observation quality layer representing each of the 16 days of the retrieval period for MODIS band 6.  

Users are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).

Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions

*	Observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.
*	MCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.
*	Better quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period. Collection 5 used only four observations per day.
*	The MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.
*	When there are insufficient high quality reflectances, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.
*	CMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid for MCD43D as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.

Important Quality Information
The incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&caseLocation=cases_data&type=C6).

"This data set reports carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) collected at several forest and pasture sites and in the free troposphere over Amazonia. There are three comma-delimited ASCII files with this data set.Atmospheric CO2 concentrations and isotope signatures were measured at ten different forest and pasture canopy sites across the states of Amazonas, Para, and Rondonia within the Brazilian Amazon between March 1999 and March 2004. Both daytime and nighttime profile samples were collected.Samples of CO2 in the troposphere were collected during aircraft flights over the Amazon/Tapajos Rivers, FLONA Tapajos, and pasture/agriculture areas during five days in May 2003 (wet season). Samples were analyzed for carbon and oxygen isotopes of atmospheric CO2. Flights ranged from low altitudes to above the diurnal tropospheric boundary layer.Measurements of carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are a powerful indicator of large-scale CO2 exchange on land across multiple spatial scales. Stable carbon isotope composition of leaf tissue and CO2 released by respiration (delta r) can be used as an estimate of changes in ecosystem isotopic discrimination that occur in response to seasonal and interannual changes in environmental conditions, and land-use change (forest-pasture conversion). Understanding of carbon dioxide stable isotope composition can play a central role in influencing our understanding of the extent to which terrestrial ecosystems are carbon sinks."

"In response to NASA SBIR Topic S1.02 on Microwave Technologies for Remote Sensing, Nuvotronics is pleased to propose a Phase I program focused on delivering an Ultra-compact W-Band High Power Transceiver. Our proposed plan is to take advantage of our PolyStrata ultra-low loss micro-coax transmission lines, high power high efficiency GaN power amplifier and Low Noise Amplifiers to provide a transceiver with over 10 Watts of CW RF power and with less than 6dB of received Noise Figure. The integrated PolyStrata micro-coax assemblies allow for a paradigm shift in design and manufacturing of advanced microwave and millimeter wave components supported by ultra-low loss transmission lines (0.03 dB/mm at 94 GHz), ultra-wideband (no cut-off), very high isolation (>80 dB) and no dispersion. This together with the highest functional density, integrated thermal management, scalability in power handling and frequency of operation enable novel architectures to be built in which the usual performance tradeoffs would no longer be necessary. In recent years, Nuvotronics has demonstrated multiple high power SSPAs from 30 GHz to 240 GHz, enabling mmW components using the disruptive PolyStrata micro-coax technology. Our architecture will also offer excellent thermal management using the PolyStrata bulk copper thermal conductivity of 400W/mK and the 3D RF backplane routing, which allow heat sink integrated directly under the MMICs for efficient heat spreading."

"The Moon breathes hydrogen: solar wind protons and micro-meteoroids deliver hydrogen to the lunar surface at local rates that depend on surface composition, local topography, and the presence of structures such as magnetic anomalies. The impinging hydrogen directly affects the surface by weakening the solid state structure as it creates defects in the lattice causing space-weathering of the surface. Because the lunar surface is generally saturated with hydrogen, the implanted hydrogen escapes the surface and forms the hydrogen exosphere through a variety of processes including sputtering, recoil, and diffusion - giving the surface an effective hydrogen ""albedo."" These processes can lead to hydrogen deposition into cold traps and the formation of OH, and possibly water, through chemical alteration of oxygen-bearing minerals. Exospheric hydrogen is reclaimed by the solar wind as picked-up photoions and charge-exchange products. The exact pathway for each of these processes remains unknown, especially at regional scales, and quantifying each of these processes in this 'lunar hydrogen cycle' as a function of solar zenith angle and plasma and space environment will lead to a unified understanding of the plasma, exospheric, and geologic Moon. Furthermore, these are fundamental processes that contribute to the transport and production of volatiles, including water, throughout the solar system."
"Radiation tolerant, extreme temperature capable electronics are needed for a variety of planned NASA missions. For example, in-situ exploration of Venus and long duration Europa-Jupiter missions will expose electronics to temperatures up to 500 Deg.C and radiation of 3 Mrad (Si) total dose. During this program, United Silicon Carbide will extend the capability of its SiC JFET integrated circuit fabrication technology to produce electronics compatible with such extreme environments.
 
Silicon Carbide (SiC) junction field effect transistor (JFET) based electronics are ideal for these environments due to their excellent radiation tolerance and high performance and reliability over an extremely wide operating temperature range. SiC electronics can be used in applications ranging from low power, low noise mixed signal electronics for precision actuator control, sensor interfaces, and guidance and navigation electronics to power electronics for power management and distribution and power processing units. Systems built with SiC based electronics will have longer storage and operating lifetimes when compared to systems built with existing silicon electronics. Use of SiC integrated circuits will also lower system mass, volume, and power by reducing or eliminating the need for cooling and radiation shielding.

In Phase I, we will perform measurements and modeling to show the feasibility of extending the capability of our SiC integrated circuit (IC) technology to meet NASA's extreme environment needs. In Phase II, we will fully develop the extreme environment capable SiC IC technology and demonstrate it through test and delivery of a high temperature, radiation hard, mixed signal sensor and control circuit. Following Phase II, we will provide access to the process technology and related design intellectual property through a commercial fabrication service so that NASA and others can fully leverage its capability."

"We will examine a system that will allow us to take a significant step towards interstellar exploration using directed energy propulsion combined with wafer scale spacecraft. One of NASA’s goals and one of humanity’s grand challenges is to explore other planetary systems by remote sensing, sending probes, and eventually life to explore. This is a long standing and difficult to implement dream. The technological challenges are formidable. A step in this direction is to send small probes that will supplement the current long range remote sensing done by orbital telescopes."

"SCARB_ER2_MAS data are Smoke, Clouds and Radiation Brazil (SCARB) NASA ER2 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) Data.Smoke/Sulfates, Clouds and Radiation - Brazil (SCAR-B) data include physical and chemical components of the Earth's surface, the atmosphere and the radiation field collected in Brazil with an emphasis in biomass burning. SCAR-B, the third SCAR experiment, was completed in September 1995, studied the effects of biomass burning on atmospheric processes and aids in the preparation of new techniques for remote sensing of these processes from space.The objectives for the SCAR mission are: to advance our knowledge of how the physical, chemical and radiative processes in our atmosphere are affected by sulfate aerosol and smoke from biomass burning; to improve our expertise at remotely sensing smoke, water vapor, clouds, vegetation and fires; and to assess the effects of deforestation and biomass burning on tropical landscapes. The MODIS Airbourne Simulator (MAS) is a modified Daedalus Wildfire scanning spectrometer which flies on a NASA ER-2 and provides spectral information similar to that provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), launched on Terra (EOS AM-1) in 1999 and Aqua (EOS PM-1) in 2002. The MAS spectrometer acquires high spatial resolution imagery in the wavelength range of 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A total of 50 spectral bands are available in this range, and the digitizer can be configured to collect data from any 12 of these bands. The digitizer was configured with four 10-bit channels and seven 8-bit channels. The MAS spectrometer was mated to a scanner subassembly which collected image data with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad, giving a ground resolution of 50 meters from 20000 meters altitude, and a cross track scan width of 85.92 degrees. The data granules were written using the self documenting file storage format provided through the netCDF interface routines included in the HDF libraries."
"The design of future habitation structures and exploration vehicles will require a higher level of crew protection from dangerous solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) than is currently provided for operations in low Earth orbit (LEO).  The incorporation of radiation shielding technology into sub-system elements will be crucial to the success of future designs.  One area where radiation shielding may be incorporated is in thermal insulation materials.  The design of habitation structures and exploration vehicles will require extensive thermal protection.  Combining the roles of radiation shielding and thermal insulation may be possible by using millimeter sized spheres in place of multi-layer insulation (MLI).  By manufacturing the spheres from materials known to provide radiation shielding, the complexity of a vehicle or habitation structure can be reduced.  An additional benefit of using spheres as insulation is the ability to operate in a weak vacuum such as the Mars atmosphere.  Thus, a sphere insulation design could also be used in the ultra-low pressure gas environment of Mars.  This project will involve the research and evaluation of materials most suitable for radiation shielding and thermal performance evaluation testing of multiple sample sizes in both vacuum and low pressure gas environments."

"TUI proposes to develop a carpal-wrist gimbal payload for the Astrobee free-flier, called 'COBRA-Bee' to satisfy Astrobee mission needs for a lightweight, integrated end-effector/tool/sensor positioning and pointing system. The COBRA-Bee is an evolution of TUI's high-TRL, 3-DOF COBRA gimbal that will provide Astrobee end-effectors with the workspace dexterity of a full robotic manipulator (6-DOF via Astrobee fan system + 3-DOF via COBRA-Bee). COBRA-Bee will support target acquisition and tracking experiments for high performance optical communication. It can also support sensors which have limited field-of-view, such as cameras, as well as sensors/end-effectors requiring high pointing accuracy and/or independence from spacecraft attitude control. The 3-DOF (azimuth, elevation, and extension) of COBRA-Bee will support Astrobee experiments with pushing operations for fanless microgravity mobility. COBRA-Bee will provide this precise multi-purpose pointing and positioning capability in a small-scale tightly integrated COTS product, with an interface to support third-party sensors, end-effectors, and tools.  The Phase I effort will define requirements for a detailed design, based upon a crew safety analysis and a survey of candidate Astrobee end-effectors. A demonstration will be performed with existing COBRA hardware, maturing the COBRA-Bee TRL to 4.  The Phase II effort will develop, test, and deliver an engineering unit and control software."
"The Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) from NOAA-16 Level-3 monthly zonal mean (MZM) product (SBUV2N16L3zm) is derived from the Level-2 retrieved ozone profiles. Ozone retrievals are generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm. A Level-3 MZM file computes zonal means covering 5 degree latitude bands for each calendar month. For this product there are 154 months of data from October 2000 through July 2013. There are a total of 36 latitudinal bands, 18 in each hemisphere. Profile data are provided at 21 layers from 1013.25, 639.318, 403.382,254.517, 160.589, 101.325,63.9317, 40.3382, 25.4517, 16.0589, 10.1325, 6.39317,4.03382, 2.54517, 1.60589, 1.01325,0.639317, 0.403382, 0.254517, 0.160589 and 0.101325 hPa (measured at bottom of layer). NOTE: Some profiles have 20 layers and do not report the top most layer. Mixing ratios are reported at 15 layers from 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 and 50.0 hPa (measured at middle of layer). 

The MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:

 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees).
 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).

NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.

The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:

 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.
 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.
 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15)."
"<p>Anomaly detection is a process of identifying items, events or observations, which do not conform to an expected pattern in a dataset or time series. Current and future missions and our research communities challenge us to rapidly identify features and anomalies in complex and voluminous observations to further science and improve decision support. Given this data intensive reality, we propose to develop an anomaly detection system, called OceanXtremes, powered by an intelligent, elastic Cloud-based analytic service backend that enables execution of domain-specific, multi-scale anomaly and feature detection algorithms across the entire archive of ocean science datasets. A parallel analytics engine will be developed as the key computational and data-mining core of OceanXtreams' backend processing. This analytic engine will demonstrate three new technology ideas to provide rapid turn around on climatology computation and anomaly detection: 1. An adaption of the Hadoop/MapReduce framework for parallel data mining of science datasets, typically large 3 or 4 dimensional arrays packaged in NetCDF and HDF. 2. An algorithm profiling service to efficiently and cost-effectively scale up hybrid Cloud computing resources based on the needs of scheduled jobs (CPU, memory, network, and bursting from a private Cloud computing cluster to public cloud provider like Amazon Cloud services). 3. An extension to industry-standard search solutions (OpenSearch and Faceted search) to provide support for shared discovery and exploration of ocean phenomena and anomalies, along with unexpected correlations between key measured variables. We will use a hybrid Cloud compute cluster (private Eucalyptus on-premise at JPL with bursting to Amazon Web Services) as the operational backend. The key idea is that the parallel data-mining operations will be run 'near' the ocean data archives (a local 'network' hop) so that we can efficiently access the thousands of (say, daily) files making up a three decade time-series, and then cache key variables and pre-computed climatologies in a high-performance parallel database. OceanXtremes will be equipped with both web portal and web service interfaces for users and applications/systems to register and retrieve oceanographic anomalies data. By leveraging technology such as Datacasting (Bingham, et.al, 2007), users can also subscribe to anomaly or 'event' types of their interest and have newly computed anomaly metrics and other information delivered to them by metadata feeds packaged in standard Rich Site Summary (RSS) format. Upon receiving new feed entries, users can examine the metrics and download relevant variables, by simply clicking on a link, to begin further analyzing the event. The OceanXtremes web portal will allow users to define their own anomaly or feature types where continuous backend processing will be scheduled to populate the new user-defined anomaly type by executing the chosen data mining algorithm (i.e. differences from climatology or gradients above a specified threshold). Metadata on the identified anomalies will be cataloged including temporal and geospatial profiles, key physical metrics, related observational artifacts and other relevant metadata to facilitate discovery, extraction, and visualization. Products created by the anomaly detection algorithm will be made explorable and subsettable using Webification (Huang, et.al, 2014) and OPeNDAP (http://opendap.org) technologies. Using this platform scientists can efficiently search for anomalies or ocean phenomena, compute data metrics for events or over time-series of ocean variables, and efficiently find and access all of the data relevant to their study (and then download only that data).</p>"

"Monitoring space radiation and the dose received by astronauts is important, especially for future long-duration missions. Neutrons contribute a significant component to the total radiation dose during solar events. We propose to develop a rugged, compact, lightweight, non-hazardous CMOS-based detector technology for an existing neutron spectroscopic dosimeter system.  The existing system utilizes a unique gelled scintillation material, which enables the discrimination of neutron signals from gamma background using time profile of the scintillation signal.  
We will demonstrate that the ultra-compact CMOS-SSPM integrated with its readout electronics can replace photomultiplier tubes and its discrete readout components used in the existing neutron spectroscopic dosimeter system.  When coupled to the existing system, the proposed technology will demonstrate a technology readiness level of 4.  This provides the necessary basis for a flight-ready neutron spectrometer system able to efficiently detect neutrons with energies up to 150MeV, and capable of rejecting gamma-ray and charged particle backgrounds using, respectively, the pulse shape discrimination characteristic of the gel scintillation detector and the of anti-coincidence scintillation detectors."

"Understanding the ageing mechanisms of electronic components critical avionics systems such as the GPS and INAV are of critical importance. Electrolytic capacitors and MOSFET’s have higher failure rates among the components of DC-DC power converter systems. Our current work focuses on analyzing and modeling electrolytic capacitor degradation and its effects on the output of DC-DC converter systems. The output degrada- tion is typically measured by an increase in ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) and decrease in the capacitance value over long periods of use even under nominal operating conditions. Typically the primary effect of degradation is increased ripple current and this has adverse effects on downstream components. For example, in avionics systems where the power supply drives a GPS unit, ripple currents can cause glitches in the GPS position and velocity output, and this may cause errors in the Inertial Navigation (INAV) system, causing the aircraft to fly off course. In this paper, we present the details of our ageing methodology along with details of experiments and analysis of the results."
"The objective of GEO is to fulfill a vision of a world where decisions and actions are informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth Observation (EO). This is being pursued mainly through the added value of coordinating existing institutions, organized communities, space agencies, insitu monitoring agencies, scientific institutions, research centres, universities, modelling centres, technology developers and other groups that deal with one or more aspects of EO. To reach this overarching goal, GEO focuses on capacity development in three dimensions: infrastructure, individuals and institutions. In the field of agriculture, the general goal is to promote the utilization of Earth observations for advancing sustainable agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries. Key issues include early warning, risk assessment, food security, market efficiency and combating desertification.

Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Satellite Orbit Product from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute various DORIS products from data generated by the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. These products include orbits of satellites with DORIS receivers onboard. These orbit products are available in SP1 or SP3 orbit format.
The Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space to study the effectiveness of a potential countermeasure for the loss of muscle and bone mass that occurs during spaceflight. Twenty BALB/c 18-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the AEM-X habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight ground controls and basal groups had blood collected then were euthanized had one hind limb removed and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection.

"Dust Impact Detection System (DIDSY) consists of six independent subsystems with the primary aim of registering the impacts of all particulates of significant mass incident on the probe during the post-perihelion encounter with Comet Halley in 1986. Mounted on Giotto's front dust shield, the detectors will determine the mass spectrum of the dust, with a limiting sensitivity of some 10^^-17^^ g, increasing to the largest grain masses encountered along Giotto's trajectory through the cometary environment with an ultimate spatial resolution of some 70 km. An additional detector is located on the rear shield to monitor those dust particles (m > ~ 5 X 10^^-7^^ g) that are able to penetrate the front dust shield. An ambient plasma monitor is also incorporated into DIDSY to measure the inJpact plasma generated by both dust and gas impacts on the spacecraft. The system is controlled and its data processed by a microprocessor-based system that allows the wide range of anticipated impact rates (varying from a few per minute, to ~ 10^6 s^^-1^^ at closest approach) to be handled. The instrument weighs 2.26 kg and consumes 1.9 W of power during normal operation."
"Achieving low-cost space missions implies lowering all phases of mission development, including spacecraft design, assembly, integration and test. The concept of the wireless spacecraft bus is something most technical people are at least half familiar with - the half which includes wireless data transfer, something available on every computer laptop today. But wireless is not really wireless if the power is delivered through wires. Both power and data need to be delivered wirelessly for the true potential impact of wireless to be made on spacecraft design, build, integration, and test.
Integrating today's commonplace wireless data systems into spacecraft would seem to be a logical step in spacecraft development, but to date has not been implemented widely if at all. AeroAstro proposes an innovative solution to design and build micro-spacecraft (and spacecraft components) harnessing the true promise of wireless systems. The overall objective of the proposal is to develop and demonstrate a truly wireless spacecraft bus - exhibiting not only wireless data, but also wireless power distribution. By definition, this wireless approach is inherently modular, and alleviates the need for wire harnesses of any type while simultaneously making staged built-in-test possible concurrently during spacecraft assembly."

"The proposed innovation is to use the comm-based measurements available from many advanced satellite cluster wireless networks to improve the flexibility and robustness of relative and absolute navigation systems without the additional expense, weight and power that a traditional navigation backup systems (like an extra GPS receiver) would require.

"We propose a hollow reservoir cathode to improve performance in ion and Hall thrusters.  We will adapt our existing reservoir cathode technology to this purpose.  Reservoir cathodes are the only emission sources that are capable of supplying the necessary current density (>5.0 A/cm2) and life (>100,000 hours) for next generation high-power thrusters.  More powerful thrusters are needed for interplanetary and lunar missions, as well as earth escape and near-earth space maneuvers.  Reservoir cathodes are able to sustain high rates of barium diffusion to the cathode surface to overcome the high rate of barium removal in ion engines. The key Phase I innovation was flexible supports for the cathode matrix.  This prevented the matrix fractures and reservoir leaks of previous reservoir cathodes for ion engines.  Cathode operation and stability was verified.  In Phase II,the design is refined and tested in actual ion engines.
 
The key challenge is the stresses exerted on the cathode tube and reservoir due to differential expansion and large temperature excursions.  These originate from the outside heater and also from heating due to collisions with the cathode.  These stresses can lead to fractures and weld failure.  Our innovation solves this problem.  This was proven on the Phase I device.

In Phase II we further test and optimize the Phase I device and perform life testing on it.  We build cathode assemblies for insertion into ion engines which we test in an ion environment at e beam, JPL and Colorado State University.  Their maximum specific impulse will be measured."
"CER_SSF_Aqua-FM3-MODIS_Edition4A is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA)/Surface Fluxes, Clouds and Aerosols Aqua-Flight Model 3 (FM3) Edition4A data product, which was collected using the CERES-FM3 instrument on the Aqua platform. Data collection for this product is in progress.
CERES SSF TOA/Surface Fluxes are data for a single scanner instrument. The SSF combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from a higher-resolution imager such as Visible/Infrared Scanner (VIRS) on the Tropical Measuring Mission (TRMM), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi- National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP). Scene identification and cloud properties are defined at the higher imager resolution and these data are averaged over the larger CERES footprint. For each CERES footprint, the SSF contains the number of cloud layers and for each layer the cloud amount, height, temperature, pressure, optical depth, emissivity, ice and liquid water path, and water particle size. The SSF also contains the CERES filtered radiances for the total, shortwave (SW), and window (WN) channels and the unfiltered SW, longwave (LW), and WN radiances. The SW, LW, and WN radiances at spacecraft altitude are converted to TOA fluxes based on the imager-defined scene. These TOA fluxes are used to estimate surface fluxes. On the SSF, only footprints with adequate imager coverage are included, which are much less than the full set of footprints on the CERES ES-8 product.
CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017."

"Historically, designing a nuclear thermal rocket engine and determining fuel performance has been a refractory and anfractuous process.  Typically, fuel forms would be developed and tested in separate tests of mechanical, radiation and thermal testing, and, in the NERVA program, the fuel elements were assembled in a rocket engine and tested.  The fuel did not perform to expectations, and the engine needed to be disassembled, the fuel examined and fixed needed to be determined; then the process would repeat itself.

In the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Program, individual fuel elements were tested, but they could not be tested to full power density due to test reactor limitations.  Nevertheless, this was a far less expensive approach that full engine testing to determine whether the fuel elements in particular would withstand the rigors of the NRE (Nuclear Rocket Engine) mission. 
This proposal outline how LPS and its team members plan to integrate the latest in multi-physics model to simulate a fuel element based on a particular NRE design built up from designer parameters.  The multi-physics modules can determine fuel integrity and fission product retention as a function of temperature and operating times, determine micro-structure evolution including cracking and grain growth.  The fuel element parameters are derived from high level NRE requirements via the integration of the IROC (Integrated Rocket Optimization Code), linked with PHOENIX, a program linking multi-physics modules through MOOSE (Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment)  Ultimately, detailed safety related information including results of impact analyses through extensive hydro-codes such as PRONTO/SPH and radiation transport codes such as MACCS2.  This enables safety to be integrated in from the very beginning of the design process resulting in a much more optimized safety based nuclear rocket engine."

It contains Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) S-4G Scanner (SC) 2.5 degrees Regional Averages in Hierarchical Data Format. Data collection for this data set is complete.

ERBE was a multi-satellite system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget. The ERBE instruments flew on a mid-inclination National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, NOAA-9 and NOAA-10. NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 provided global coverage and the ERBS provided coverage between 67.5 degrees north and south latitude. Each satellite carried both a scanner and a non-scanner instrument package. The scanner instrument package contained three detectors to measure shortwave (0.2 to 5 microns), longwave (5 to 50 microns) and total waveband radiation (.2 to 50 microns). Each detector normally scanned the Earth perpendicular to the satellite ground-track from horizon-to-horizon. The detectors were thermistors which used space views on every scan as a reference point to guard against drift. They were located at the focal point of a f/1.84 Cassegrain telescope, whose aluminum-coated mirrors were overcoated to enhance ultraviolet reflectivity. The total channel had no filter; therefore it absorbed all wavelengths. The shortwave channel was a fused silica filter which transmitted only shortwave radiation. The longwave channel was a multilayer filter on a diamond substrate to reject shortwave energy and accept longwave. To enhance the spectral flatness of the detectors, each thermistor chip was coated with a thin layer of black paint. The effective field of view of the scanner was 3 degrees. The ERBE S-4G product contained averages of radiant flux and albedo on regional, zonal, and global scales. The data for the S-4G product were arranged by parameter values. The various combinations of the satellites reflected the actual duration of the scanners."

"Every CubeSat design is different with different requirements.  However the number of similarities between CubeSat designs is greater than between any two larger spacecraft. Leveraging these similarities and by applying a modular design approach we can develop a small family of motherboards that can fulfill the needs of any CubeSat mission.  The computing elements of a 1-3U motherboard and a 6U motherboard are the same.  The differences between these CubeSat bus architectures exist outside the computing element.  Thus, we can move the computing elements off of the motherboard and into a self-contained Compute Module (CM).  The CM contains all the elements needed for a self-contained computer.  The CM is attached to an Application Specific Daughter Card (ASDC).  Together the CM and ASDC provide the capabilities needed for a specific task.  This standard module will consist of a physical form factor, electrical connections and design specifications for the ASDC.  The initial Compute Module (CM) design specifications will utilize SST' modified ARM&#174; Cortex&#174;-M0 microcontroller, motherboard for the 1-3U and a 6U CubeSat bus configuration."
"EPIR Inc. and Brimrose Technology Corporation propose a miniaturized spectrometer covering the 0.35 to 2.3um wavelength range by integrating a Hg1-xCdxTe (MCT) - based photodetector (PD) with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). The goal is to achieve 4um spectral resolution with wide dynamic range to measure both the Sun's and the Moon's radiometric characteristics. Currently the best known infrared photon detectors used for spectroscopy are based on MCT. With an adjustable bandgap and little lattice mismatch, MCT photon detectors with high quantum efficiency are sensitive to a very broad spectral range. The proposing company, EPIR, is the leading small business in MCT growth, characterization and focal plane array (FPA) fabrication. The spectroscopic filter is an important component of any spectrometer. Compared with other technologies, e.g. Michelson or Offner interferometers, the proposed AOTF offers high spectral resolution, with the advantages of high speed, programmable waveband selection flexibility, and arbitrary wavelength step size. An AOTF has no moving parts and can be integrated with a MCT photodetector monolithically. The biggest advantage of the proposed spectrometer is its compact system design that reduced size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP), offering significant benefits to the payload as well as in the operation of missions."

"Producing return fuel on Mars rather than carrying it from Earth significantly reduces the mass that must be lifted from Earth for a manned mission to Mars.  The most practical propulsion combination that can be produced is methane and oxygen.  Using propellant components made on Mars to generate electric power on the return voyage further reduces the mass that must be lifted.  

We are proposing to develop an energy conversion system to utilize the components of this propulsion combination to generate electricity for that voyage.  The core of the system will be a direct methane oxygen solid oxide fuel cell (DMSOFC).  To enhance conversion efficiency we will use the waste heat from the fuel cell stack to produce additional electricity before it is radi-ated away.  (The combined efficiency of all stages of this system will exceed 70%.)

Phase I will select an anode electrocatalyst, demonstrate a single cell fuel cell, select a heat re-covery system, and develop a design for the complete system, which will be built in Phase II."

"The main goal of this study was to analyze the possibility of estimating combustion completeness based on fire-induced spectral reflectance changes of surface features by the development of relationships between combustion completeness and pre-fire to post-fire spectral reflectance changes, in the green, red, and near-infrared spectral domains (equivalent to Landsat ETM+ channels 2, 3, and 4)."

"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."
"This dataset provides Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model outputs for receptors located at the NOAA Barrow Alaska Observatory for 12 selected years (15 August to 15 October) across the 30-year, 1982 to 2011, study timeframe. Meteorological fields from version 3.5.1 of the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to drive STILT. STILT applies a Lagrangian particle dispersion model backwards in time from a measurement location (the ""receptor"" location), to create the adjoint of the transport model in the form of a ""footprint"" field. The footprint, with units of mixing ratio (ppm --- CO2; ppb --- CH4) per (umol m-2 s-1 --- CO2; nmol m-2 s-1 --- CH4), quantifies the influence of upwind surface fluxes on concentrations measured at the receptor and is computed by counting the number of particles in a surface-influenced volume and the time spent in that volume. The simulation results included in this dataset are crucial for understanding changes in Arctic carbon cycling and are part of a retrospective analysis to link changes in atmospheric composition at Arctic receptor sites with shifts in ecosystem structure and function. Each file provides the surface influence-function footprints on a lat/lon/time grid from WRF-STILT simulations for the receptor location."

"The MCD43D47 Version 6.1 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) Black-Sky Albedo dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter (m)) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each MCD43D product contains just one data layer. 

MCD43D42 through MCD43D61 are the albedo products of the MCD43D BRDF/Albedo product suite. There are 10 black-sky albedo and 10 white-sky albedo layers representing MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands. The black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a diffuse component and is a function of solar zenith angle. White-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a direct component when the diffuse component is isotropic. 

MCD43D47 is the black-sky albedo for MODIS band 6. 

The MODIS BRDF/Albedo products have achieved stage 3 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) validation.

Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions

* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.
* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB)."

"This proposed work will develop a new method and mechanism for generating wing stroke motion of any shape and orientation.  The mechanism will provide power, lift and flight control to small aircraft in a single integrated unit.  The key innovation is the means by which wing motion is generated without the use any complex mechanical components.  Wing motion of any shape and orientation can be generated with this mechanism.  The arrangement of wings is such that the mechanism is mechanically balanced and exerts no net torque or force on the aircraft.  This method is applicable to small UAVs (uninhabited aerial vehicles) and will provide them with a simple and reliable means of producing power, lift and flight control.  The versatility of this mechanism is expected to provide UAVs with high maneuverability.  This method will be most valuable for UAVs that are used as planetary aircraft as well as for general surveillance and reconnaissance."

"This dataset provides a regional multivariate oceanographic state estimate from a global ocean numerical simulation with a focus on the Marmara Sea region. The global ocean simulation is based on the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) with Lat-Lon-Cap grid (LLC) layout and 1/48-degree (2km at equator) nominal horizontal resolution. This simulation is often referred to as LLC4320 in the community and existing publications. The simulation has 90 vertical levels, with about 1-m vertical resolution at the surface and 30 m down to 500 m, for optimized resolution of the upper-ocean processes. The model has zero parameterized horizontal diffusivity. In the vertical direction, the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) is used for boundary layer turbulent mixing. It is spun up progressively from the lower resolution MITgcm simulation from the Estimating the Circulation & Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), and forced by the 6-hourly ERA-Interim atmosphere reanalysis ( https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era-interim ). A synthetic surface pressure field consisting of the 16 most dominant tidal constituents is used to dynamically mimic the tidal forcing. The dataset provides hourly oceanographic variables at native grid. Three-dimensional variables include temperature, salinity, and velocity. Two-dimensional variables include sea level anomaly, ocean mixed layer thickness, bottom pressure anomaly, net freshwater flux, net heat flux, shortwave radiative flux, net salt flux, and ocean surface stress."

"Future advanced telescopes require active mirror compensation without
the complexity of real-time adaptive control. Current wavefront
correctors, while dimensionally stable, require closed loop control
using a wavefront sensor and complicated electronics to maintain mirror
shape. For space based systems, simplified open loop control is
desirable since it reduces power and weight while greatly improving
system reliability by reducing complexity and electronic parts count.
Xinetics proposes a Programmable Relaxor Open-Loop Mirror using
Integrated Spatial Encoders (PROMISE) that combines surface parallel
actuation and micro optical encoders. The programmable relaxor open-loop
mirror uses a surface parallel actuator array, made using ferroelectric
micromachining originally developed for silicon based MEMS. The
programmable actuator array enables the dimensionally stability and
angstrom level control provided only by relaxor ferroelectrics, as has
been demonstrated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The integrated
spatial encoder features an optical encoder that monitors dimensional
change and is integrated directly between the actuator array and the
surface mount interconnect. The voltage output of the optical encoder is
used as a direct input to the feedback loop for the actuator circuit
enabling electroactive control of the mirror surface without the
necessity of an optical sensor, thereby enabling open loop control."
To reveal outcomes of microgravity on molecular processes within the cellular environment we have employed a mass-spectrometry based proteomics approach. Proteomics analysis based on mass spectrometry allows for the relative quantitation of a large number of proteins concurrently and in a relatively unbiased manner. Mass spectrometry based proteomics can be rendered even more informative by addition of a labeling component to understand the dynamics of the changing protein content. In this study we utilized a combination of proteomics techniques namely label-free quantification and dynamic stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (Dynamic SILAC) to characterize the microgravity stress response in primary cardiomyocytes.

"Impact Technologies LLC, in cooperation the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative Automated Contingency Management (ACM) concept for advanced propulsion systems that will provide a superior level of engine fault accommodation and optimized performance based on a seamless integration between the engine health management (EHM) system and the engine controller.   Utilizing a sophisticated engine simulation model with full transient capability and integrated control, a software-in-the-loop demonstration will be delivered that will be capable of realistically simulating various control sensor failures, actuator faults, and engine degradation scenarios with associated results obtained comparing the benefits of the ACM technologies implemented.  

The proposed ACM software hierarchy will act from the engine subsystems level up through the air vehicle level and will implement advanced fault-accommodating control, health management, and intelligent software agents to accomplish its goal.  The core innovations of this project include: 1.) The development of advanced fault detection algorithms for sensor, actuator and component faults in different flight regimes; 2.) The development of intelligent software agents for achieving optimal dynamic performance under faulty propulsion dynamics; and 3.) The development of reconfigurable control algorithms linked to the EHM system for guaranteeing the stability of the fault-accommodating control system."
"The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) is a NASA atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) with its Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (ADAS), version 5.12.4. The MERRA project focuses on historical climate analyses for a broad range of weather and climate time scales and places the NASA EOS suite of observations in a climate context. 
	
	MERRA-2 was initiated as an intermediate project between the aging MERRA data and the next generation of Earth system analysis envisioned for the future coupled reanalysis. Without a substantial investment to update MERRA's data assimilation routines, the system lacked the capability to analyze the latest observations. In addition, numerous advances to the GEOS5 system had been implemented since freezing the MERRA system in 2008. Therefore, a new full reanalysis integration was undertaken. MERRA-2 covers the period 1980-present, continuing as an ongoing climate analysis as resources allow.

"The Monthly Gridded Cloud Averages (ISCCP-D2like-Mrg) data product contains monthly and monthly 3-hourly (GMT-based) gridded regional mean cloud properties as a function of 18 cloud types, similar to the ISCCP D2 product, where the cloud properties are stratified by pressure, optical depth, and phase. The Mrg product combines daytime cloud properties from Terra-MODIS (10:30 AM local equator crossing time LECT), Aqua-MODIS (1:30 PM LECT), and geostationary satellites (GEO) to provide the most diurnally complete daytime ISCCP-D2like product. The GEO cloud properties have been normalized with MODIS for diurnal consistency. The CERES MODIS-derived cloud properties are not the official NASA MODIS cloud retrievals, but are based on the CERES cloud working group retrievals that are also available in other CERES products. The CERES MODIS-derived cloud properties provide coverage from pole to pole. The 3-hourly GMT-based GEO cloud properties come from five satellites at 8km nominal resolution with coverage limited to to . The GEO daytime cloud retrievals incorporate only a visible and IR channel common to all geostationary satellites for spatial consistency. The geostationary calibration is normalized to Terra-MODIS. Each ISCCP-D2like file covers a single month.Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels.

"The objective of this proposal is to study and demonstrate novel
GaAsNP/GaP/AlGaP technology for use in extreme photovoltaic (PV) energy
conversion.  NASA and the scientific community are interested in solar
missions that go as far as Saturn or even into near sun conditions.
Such missions present a challenging problem for PV technology.  In
addition to the requisite high efficiency and reduced solar cell payload
mass, these missions require a PV technology that can withstand the
increased solar intensity, radiation and temperature.   We propose
studying two possible solar cell designs:  The first design utilizes
novel, wide gap GaP-based materials to provide bandgaps well suited for
high-temperature operation and to enhance function in high radiation and
near sun missions.  Such an approach will enable solar cells to operate
at and above 450 Celcius with the highest possible efficiency.  As part
of this study we would investigate the deposition of AlGaP on GaP to
provide materials with bandgaps at or above 2.4 eV.  The second design
we will investigate uses more standard materials that EpiWorks has
already developed for different applications.  This design would employ
InAlP (2.4eV bandgap) lattice-matched to GaAs as the key wide gap
material.  We will study the expected temperature dependence and other
key thermal properties of such a design and compare to the GaP-based approach."

"This data set provides a time series of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes for five (Path/Row) areas in Rondonia, Brazil. The scenes are from the period June 1975 through June 2000, but all areas do not have scenes for all the years. The areas and Landsat Path/Rows included are as follows: Ariquemes (P232,R67), Ji-Parana (P231, R67), Luiza (P231, R68), Cacoal (P230, R68), and Porto Velho (P232, R66). TM images are available for all five areas. Because of a paucity of digital Landsat MSS imagery from the 1970s, only two scenes could be included, a 1975 scene from Ariquemes and a 1978 scene from Ji-Parana. Each of the Landsat scenes has been coregistered to a Path/Row-specific georectified PRODES Landsat file obtained from the Brazilian Government's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) program. For each scene, the coregistration is accurate to within (plus or minus)1 pixel (30-m Landsat resolution) in most places. The five INPE PRODES Landsat scenes used in the georectification process are included with this data set. There are five compressed files (tar.gz format) with this data set. When expanded, each compressed file (which corresponds to one of the five areas) contains a directory for each scene with GeoTIFF files for individual Landsat bands, a text file of tie points, and another text file of slope and intercept values for converting radiance to reflectance. There are two dates for Landsat MSS scenes, 45 dates for TM scenes, and six dates for ETM+ scenes."
"Thermal anemometry (a.k.a. hot-wire anemometry) has been a key experimental technique in fluid mechanics for many decades. Due to the small physical size and high frequency response of the sensors (resulting in excellent spatial and temporal resolution), the technique has been widely used for studies of turbulent flows. Even with the advent of nonintrusive techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), hot wire anemometry is uniquely capable of extremely high frequency response and fine spatial resolution measurements. ViGYAN has demonstrated a fundamental change to the anemometer configuration, with two related aspects. First, the circuitry to power the sensor and establish its operating point is packaged immediately adjacent to the sensor, i.e. in the typical probe holder, removing the effect of the cable connecting the sensor to an external anemometer. Second, modern analog-digital conversion hardware has been employed to the maximum extent possible,  including directly driving the sensor. Data transmission is fully digital, immune to environmental variations or electrical noise. Based on these results, the Phase II work will deploy this ""Digital Bridge"" system using a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) device connected via fiber-optic cable the miniaturized ""probe holder"" electronics. The DSP will be controlled by a generic PC with software to control the system and acquire/store data. A production-ready version will be developed and delivered; facilities, expertise, and resources are available to fabricate and deliver production units at the conclusion of Phase II. Production designs for ruggedized units will also be done for use in wind tunnels that operate at higher dynamic pressures and extreme temperatures."
"The Interactive Data Language (IDL) is a standard tool used by many researchers in observational fields. Present day Sun-Earch Connection missions like RHESSI or SOHO, or future missions, including the Solar Dynamics (SDO) almost exclusively analyze their data in IDL. However, the increasing amount of data produced by these missions, and the increasing complexity of image processing algorithms, requires higher computing power. Cluster computing is a cost-effective way to increase the speed of computation, but algorithms have to be modified to take advantage of parallel systems. Enhancing IDL to work on clusters gives scientists access to increased performance in a familiar programming environment. We propose to develop tools that enable IDL to profit from cluster systems. These tools will allow IDL applications to run in parallel without additional licenses. Finally, the parallelization will require no significant modification of the original programs. Enhanced data analysispower enables e.g. automatic image analysis on larger data sets. It can also help to reduce the response time to analyze data on demand,as desirable in virtual observatory environments. The wide spread of IDL allows scientists from other fields to profit from the increased execution speed."
"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an innovative solar cell design that combines nanotechnology with conducting polymer photovoltaics to achieve extremely low weight, flexible solar cells of almost any size and shape that far surpass current solar cell efficiencies. This proposal demonstrates the potential of this design for increased efficiency and low weight by prototyping single-layer solar cells (compatible with future tandem-cell architecture) with spectral responses tuned to the solar spectrum.  The project develops approaches to explore the four main technical areas that are currently limiting nanocomposite photovoltaic cell performance: illumination intensity saturation, conduction efficiency, charge-separation efficiency and dispersion control of nanomaterials in a host matrix at high concentration.  In Phase I, these technical areas are explored to determine the magnitude of potential performance improvements that can be achieved by optimizing these parameters in Phase II, and compare these projections to the maximum performance predicted by theory.  In Phase II, the information gathered in Phase I will be used to produce a prototype of an optimized, lightweight, low-cost, flexible solar cell with efficiency greater than 15%; amenable to large-scale, low-temperature manufacturing and eventual transition to tandem-cell designs for efficiency > 30%."

"Sample return missions have primary importance in future planetary missions. A basic requirement is that samples be returned in pristine, uncontaminated condition, necessitating development of a canister system capable of maintaining cleanliness and seal integrity through a variety of environments. Such a canister system, the Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), is proposed. Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister also incorporates features that for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples -- seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful Apollo seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent oxidation, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process. The container body will be configured to accommodate a variety of samples including rock cores, rock fragments, regolith, dust, and frozen soil. Atmospheric samples can also be preserved. The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions."

"LIASON: Linked, Autonoums Inerplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation"
"Sensing gas molecules is critical to environmental monitoring, control of chemical processes, space missions as well as agricultural and medical applications.  Existing electrical sensor materials are based on semi-conducting metal oxides, silicon devices, organic materials and gas responsive polymers or ceramics.  To achieve high chemical sensitivity, semi-conducting metal oxide sensors must be operated at elevated temperatures (200 to 600?C).  This need for high temperature operation increases the device complexity and renders them unsuitable for real-time portable applications.  On the other hand, conducting polymers and organic semi-conductors are suitable for room temperature operation, but exhibit limited sensitivity.  Clearly, there is a need to develop new technology that will allow for operation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and provide for high-sensitivity measurements and low response times.  We have already experimentally demonstrated under our own Internal R&D funding, that carbon nanotubes provide this enabling technology
This effort will experimentally demonstrate a new nanotube sensor technology, which is a radical departure from conventional nanotube sensor approaches.  Tests already performed with the proposed carbon nanotube sensor indicate that the electrical response of each gas is unique and that the individual gas concentrations can also be determined."
"A propulsion system for small spacecraft is proposed that will be partially contained in the spacecraft structure. The preliminary design will fit into a 3-Unit (U) sized CubeSat with the payload occupying 1-U and the propulsion system occupying the remaining space. The structure of the 2-U section will be partially comprised of four additively-manufactured acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) fueled hybrid rocket motors.

Additively manufacturing the ABS fuel grains serves two purposes. One, it allows the fuel grains to be 3D printed within the overall spacecraft structure, thereby replacing structural mass with usable fuel. Once the fuel has been exhausted, a portion of the structure will remain to ensure the spacecraft structure continues to be sound. Second, unlike extruded ABS, 3D printed ABS possesses the capability to produce electrical arc ignition when a voltage is sent through electrodes embedded in the fuel grain. Such ignition coupled with the hybrid rocket motor's throttling abilities results in a reliably restartable propulsive system. Since the hybrid motor fuel and oxidizer are stored separately, there is also no chance of accidental ignition.

A safe, reliable, restartable propulsion system is desirable for small spacecraft that must participate in rideshares to reach orbit. Once placed in orbit, the spacecraft must rely on on-board propulsion for attitude and orbit control. The proposed partially-consumable structure will increase the safety and efficiency of small spacecraft propulsion compared to currently available hydrazine systems. This is significant for small spacecraft endeavors because rideshares are more likely to accept spacecraft that contain non-hazardous propulsive fuels that will not accidentally ignite. Additionally, an on-board propulsion system with restart capabilities will grant small spacecraft missions the ability to pursue a wider range of mission objectives. The proposed mass-reducing and safety- and efficiency-increasing propulsion system is an innovative enhancement for the growing small spacecraft industry."
"Latest advances in semiconductor optoelectronics makes it possible to develop compact light weight robust sources of coherent optical pulses, demanded for numerous applications such as lidars. Recent improvements in heterostructure growth and processing technology, as well as new approaches in waveguide design make it possible to integrate single frequency laser diode, saturable absorber, and semiconductor amplifier in one compact device with high wallplug efficiency and long lifetime. In this Phase I project we will design a prototype device, fabricate it and study its basic parameters."
"This is the narrow-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-5 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is about 10 km cross-track. Thus, MAC02QS0 cross-track width is 44 pixels for radiances.  Geolocations, however, are 1-km at best, and thus the cross-track width for geolocations is 11 pixels. Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.
      
In the standard product, the 250 meter MODIS Level 1B data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 2 discrete bands located in the 0.62 to 0.88 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). In addition, the Earth Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for these solar reflective bands through knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry). Additional  data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.   
      
Channel locations for the MODIS 250 meter data are as follows:

"Starting from August 6th in 2019, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI along-track high spatial resolution (~5.5km at nadir) has been implemented.
For data after August 6th of 2019, please check S5P_L2__AER_AI data collection.

The Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.

The TROPOMI UV Aerosol Index has been calculated based on wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in the UV spectral range where ozone absorption is weak. A residual value is calculated from measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and per-calculated theoretical reflectance for a Rayleigh scattering-only atmosphere given a wavelength pair. TROPOMI UVAI products use the classical wavelength pair of 340/380 nm, and the OMI chosen 354/388 nm pair for the long-term continuous AI record. Figure 1 shows TROPOMI UVAI of orbit# 4060."
"Environmental species measurement on airborne atmospheric research craft is a demanding application for optical sensing techniques.  Yet optical techniques offer many advantages including high-precision, fast response, and high species selectivity.  Balloonsonde, kite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or glider deployment demands that sensors meet stringent size, weight and power requirements.  Few measurements are as important, and none have entered into the public consciousness, like the need to quantify atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Vista Photonics proposes to develop rugged, compact, power efficient prototype optical sensors capable of selectively measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor with precision that rivals ground based instruments.  The enabling technology for meeting stringent NASA mission requirements is a newly emergent infrared laser source that delivers the high-sensitivity of established optical absorption detection techniques with extreme compactness and low power draw."

"The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STD. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.


The value for each grid box is the sum of the values that fall within the 1x1 area divided by the number of points in the
box."

"Cryogenic propellants are important to NASA's missions. Improvements in cryogenic propellant storage and transfer are critical to future long duration NASA spacecraft and missions. Advanced Cooled Shield - IMLI (ACS-IMLI) is an innovative ultra high performance system in which an Advanced Cooled Shield is fully integrated into the IMLI layer structure, reducing mass, forming a single robust system, with integrated cooled gas distribution in a cooled shield layer, eliminating heat flux through thermal shield tank standoffs or supports, and operable in both passive (vapor cooled shield) and active (broad area cooled shield) modes.

NASA's TA-02 Roadmap calls ""Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions"" the #2 ranked technical challenge for NASA mission objectives and needs.  Quest Thermal Group has developed IMLI, an advanced thermal insulation that uses proprietary discrete spacer technology to reduce heat flux. IMLI's unique structure is able to self support various loads, including a thin, lightweight vacuum shell for in-air operation, high strength ballistic layers for MMOD shielding, an external Broad Area Cooling Shield with cooling tubing, or an integrated thermal shield within the layers. IMLI's layer structure gives it unique capabilities, such as an embedded conductive, sealed thermal barrier. 

In this Phase I program, an ACS-IMLI system would be modeled, analyzed, designed, fabricated, installed on a cryotank, and tested for structural strength and thermal performance.  Advanced Cooled Shield &#150; IMLI (ACS-IMLI) could provide a lower mass, single insulation system, operable in both passive (vapor cooled) and active (cryocooled) modes, with 3 &#150; 4X lower heat flux than IMLI alone. ACS-IMLI could help meet NASA's cryogenic fluid management requirements such as Zero Boil Off for cryogenic propellant storage and transfer."

"The availability of low AC loss magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting wires enables much lighter weight superconducting stator coils than with any other metal or ceramic superconductor. This, together with Hyper Tech's capability to fabricate long piece-length (potentially 60 km) wires, in turn enables lighter superconducting motors/generators, essential components in the turboelectric aircraft propulsion system envisioned in next generation Air Vehicle Technologies. To that end, this proposed SBIR Phase I program focuses on developing MgB2 multifilament wires with the smallest practical filament size achievable (10 µm or less) as a means to reducing AC losses due to hysteresis, eddy current, and coupling losses. Two recent advancements at Hyper Tech greatly increase the odds of success: 1) The emergence of a novel MgB2 wire manufacturing method that incorporates a magnesium-infiltration process (precursor materials are magnesium wire and powder boron) that has produced a 10-fold enhancement in critical current density over that of present state-of-the-art wires made by the conventional method involving magnesium-boron powder mixtures, and 2) Improved capability in wire drawing to fabricate fine multifilament strands."

"In this SBIR Program, Structured Materials Industries, Inc. www.structuredmaterials.com (SMI), working with the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) will develop graphene wire, as a lightweight higher conductivity superior electrical power transmission cable to present copper (or aluminum) wire. Replacing metal wiring with graphene wire will result in significant weight savings for space, military, and commercial craft; translating directly to reduced fuel consumption, extended operational parameters, and increased payload.  The technology developed in this SBIR will ultimately be extended to many other systems with electrical or electronic subcomponents.  In prior wire work, SMI demonstrated the concept of producing lightweight, highly conductive wire based on multiple layers of graphene. Calculations based on that work showed that a greater than 50% weight reduction is possible by replacing copper wires with graphene wires. The weight savings increased with higher amperage wires.  We will build upon the prior work and demonstrate technology for manufacturable  production of graphene wire to NASA performance specifications.  We will also produce and deliver samples of lightweight graphene wire for evaluation by our NASA sponsors."

"The systems developed at fibertek for Obstacle-Avoidance has so far all been operated at 1560nm.  Such an operation is required due to the required eye-safety constraint.    This wavelength range has so far shown reduced efficiency to a 30% optical-optical efficiency in the last stage of optical amplification in the fiber based transmitter we have developed.  For space applications, we believe a highly efficient transmitter will be required with associated optical receiver technology.  We propose here to develop a highly efficient, very versatile transmitter based on Ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers.  Associated with this transmitter we will demonstrate a coherent detection system allowing for both range and velocity measurements during space vehicle landing. The technology required for the transmitter/receiver and scanning is at TRL 5.  A successful Phase II STTR should allow for field testing bringing this TRL to 6."

Inflatable space structures have unique characteristics that would benefit from an instrument system for detecting impact penetrations and reporting the extent of these penetrations, as well as their size and location.  Building on previous experience, (i.e. the Habitat Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) hardware and software, which was developed for the Habitat Demonstration Unit) a system particularly adapted to the multilayer inflatable space structures can be developed.   The HIMS sensors represent a class of sensors that are both low mass, simply emplaced, and require little power or system resources.  This sensor system was applied to test sample coupons, representative of inflatable structures, modified as required, and subjected to hypervelocity impacts. Results of these tests allowed system verification for this type of space structure, with the ultimate goal to achieve an automatic impact location and characterization system for the inflatable space structure.<p/><p>The goal of the Habitat particle Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) is to develop a fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection system for crewed space exploration modules, both in space and on planetary surfaces.  When micrometeoroids or orbital debris impacts occur on a space habitat, crew members need to be quickly informed of the likely extent of damage, and then take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the mission. HIMS uses multiple thin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface and characterize the impact locations and degree of penetration.  Installation of the HIMS sensors is easy, and does not require any major reconfiguration of the habitat structure. The detection capabilities of HIMS on a hard-shell structure were successfully demonstrated on the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM) during the 2010-2011 Desert Research and Technology Studies campaign. The main objective for the project in FY12 was to explore the feasibility of using HIMS for particle impact detection on multi-layer inflatable structures and determine optimum sensor configuration requirements for potential applications on future inflatable habitats. Hypervelocity impact tests were performed on a test article consisting of a spherical rubber bladder inflated within a Kevlar envelope ""restraint layer"". The tests showed that the system detects the impact in both the Kevlar layer and the rubber bladder.  The ring-down acoustic response of the simplified target indicates a signal detection range of at least 3 m from the point of impact.  It is hypothesized that an actual inflatable structure, with higher stiffness and thicker walls, would propagate the acoustical signals with less loss. Thus the system design and sensor configuration for inflatable structures is expected to be similar to designs and configurations already tested on rigid structures.</p>"

"Aquarius Level 3 sea surface salinity (SSS) rain-flagged standard mapped image data contains gridded 1 degree spatial resolution SSS averaged over
daily, 7 day, monthly, and seasonal time scales.  This particular data set is the Daily rain-flagged rain-flagged sea surface salinity product for version 5.0 of the Aquarius data set. The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit.  Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath."
"The growing use in deep space of CubeSats is driving the need for small, flexible, full-featured telecom hardware like the Iris radio. The current Iris software is rudimentary compared the NASA Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS). The software on each slice uses a simple 333 kHz loop as a basic scheduler to invoke small C elements. Changes can only be made before the radio is installed in the spacecraft, and no code updates in flight are possible without patching.

This proposal would result in software to enable simple, low-effort elaboration of new capabilities for the Iris and similar radios.

1. Telecom Abstraction Layer (TAL) implements STRS capabilities, plus the infrastructure to dynamically select waveform applications on any sort of radio. A high-speed scheduler selects apps to run, collects execution information for debug, and reconfigures the system for needed operations. The TAL can be targeted to any radio with the modification of an i/o layer.
2. Plug-in Cognition Architecture (PiCA) running on a separate slice for cognitive link services, interfaced to each radio slice via serial. Services could include downlink rate selection in response to DSN site conditions, guaranteed data delivery, relay, antenna pointing, and access negotiation. Built-atop flight-proven VML sequencing and JPL AutoNav for spacecraft navigation, easy-to-code scripts provide sophisticated timing and event response, making cognitive services easy to write and deploy, even after launch.

The longer-duration computations of the PiCA do not interfere with the high-rate waveform activities in the TAL. Both can be updated with new components at any point in the mission, allowing unprecedented flexibility to take advantage of new technologies or compensate for spacecraft idiosyncrasies.

PASDR has the potential to shorten radio development cycles and allow easy collaboration between separate developers, benefiting the community as a whole."
"The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is responsible for the archive and distribution of NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs)(https://earthdata.nasa.gov/community/community-data-system-programs/measures-projects) SRTM, which includes the global 3 arc second (~90 meter) sub-sampled product. The 3 arc second data was derived from the 1 arc second using sampling methods. (See Figure 3 in the User Guide (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf)

The NASA SRTM data sets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. This collaboration aims to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was the primary (and virtually only) payload on the STS-99 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.

The SRTMGL3 data were sub-sampled from SRTM1GL (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1.003) data that fall within that tile. These elevation files use the extension “.HGT”, meaning height (such as N37W105.SRTMGL3S.HGT). The primary goal of creating the Version 3 data was to eliminate gaps, or voids, that were present in earlier versions of SRTM data. In areas with limited data, existing topographical data were used to supplement the SRTM data to fill the voids. The source of each elevation pixel is identified in the corresponding SRTMGL3N  (http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL3N.003) product (such as N37W105.SRTMGL3N.NUM).

The SRTM swaths extended from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km), creating swaths ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60° N and 56° S latitude to account for 80% of Earth’s total landmass.

"Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Enhanced Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) observations at 340 and 388 nm are used to derive near UV aerosol properties. The EPIC aerosol retrieval algorithm (EPICAERUV) uses a set of aerosol models to account for the presence of carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning and wild fires (BIO), desert dust (DST), and sulfate-based (SLF) aerosols. These aerosol models are identical to those assumed in the OMI algorithm (Torres et al., 2007; Jethva and Torres, 2011). Aerosol data products generated by the EPICAERUV algorithm are aerosol extinction optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) at 340, 388 and 500 nm for clear sky conditions. AOD of absorbing aerosols above clouds is also reported (Jethva et al., 2018). In addition, the UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) is calculated from 340 and 388 nm radiances for all sky conditions. AOD is a dimensionless measure of the extinction of light y aerosols due to the combined effect of scattering and absorption. SSA represents the fraction of extinction solely due to aerosol scattering effects. The AI is simply a residual parameter that quantifies the difference in spectral dependence between measured and calculated near UV radiances assuming a purely molecular atmosphere. Because most of the observed positive residuals are associated with the presence of absorbing aerosols, this parameter is commonly known as the UV Absorbing Aerosol Index. EPIC-derived aerosol parameters are reported at a 10 km (nadir) resolution."
"<p>In this task, our objective is to design and implement a variable coded modulation (VCM) system capable of significantly increasing the data return of Space-to-Earth communications links, compared to non-VCM systems. This meets NASA's goal of more power and spectral-efficient technology, and is an enabling component of cognitive networks.<p/><p>Background. NASA missions undergo wide variation in communications link conditions. Over the course of months, the range changes dramatically from launch, to cruise, to say, Mars orbit, but link conditions change on much shorter time scales, as well. For example, a typical track of MRO tracked by the Deep-Space Network might start at antenna elevation 11°, rise to 72°, and then fall to 8° over a twelve hour period. Recent and near-future NASA missions have their data rates limited by dynamic effects such as weather (e.g., MRO Ka-band links), solar scintillation (e.g. Solar Probe), on-board interference (e.g., MRO CRISM interference), launch plumes, and other effects. A 2005 Mars Technology Program study reported that up to 50% more data can be returned on a typical Mars-lander to Mars-orbiter link when adaptive data rates are used on the link. Our task is to extend the concept of adaptive data rates to variable and adaptive coded modulation, in which the dynamic power and bandwidth resources can be much more effectively utilized. A 2010 study by ESA determined that in one practical scenario, a VCM system could more than double the total data volume returned. Our task is to make effective use of the CCSDS standard coded-modulations, thereby allowing us to operate close to the unconstrained capacity limit, regardless of link conditions. To do this, we will develop a physical-layer design that allows the transmitter to switch between coded modulations on a codeword-to-codeword basis, a mechanism to inform the receiver which coded modulation is being used, and the receiver tracking structures necessary to identify the coded-modulation and demodulate and decode the data appropriately.</p>"
"Version 5 is the current version of the data set. Version 4 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 5.

This product contains the calibrated received power from the Ka-band of the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) aboard the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission.

One of the reasons for adding the Ka-band frequency (35.5 GHz) channel to the DPR is to provide information on the drop-size distribution that can be obtained from non-Rayleigh scattering effects at the higher frequency. Another reason for the new Ka-band channel is to provide more accurate estimates of the phase-transition height in precipitating systems. This information is very important not only in increasing the accuracy of rain rate estimation by the DPR itself, but in improving rain estimation by passive microwave radiometers.

The Ka-band Radar has a more complex scanning geometry, defined by two modes: Matched (MS) and High-sensitivity (HS). In the first type of scan (MS), the Ka Radar beams are matched to the central 25 beams of the Ku Radar, providing a swath of 120 km (within the 245km swath of the Ku Radar). In the second type of scan (HS), the Ka is operated in the high-sensitivity mode to detect light rain and snow.  In this case, its beams are interlaced within the matched scan pattern, resulting in 49 cross-track beams which, however, still cover the 120-km swath."

"Current NASA programs, such as Adaptable, Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) and Woven Thermal Protection Systems (WTPS) are looking to fill a gap in ablative TPS for future missions to Venus and Saturn, human missions beyond Lunar, and Mars Sample Return Missions.  Both of these programs rely on the use of 3D woven carbon fiber preforms.  Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves, significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations. While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties, textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused on modeling this class of materials. Materials Research & Design (MR&D) has experience in working with and designing 3D woven preforms for use in composite material reinforcement and has developed a suite of analytical tools to define the detailed geometry of 3D woven preforms for use in calculating material properties.  However, these tools currently do not have the capability to predict material strengths.  Within the proposed Phase I effort, MR&D will enhance the existing tool by incorporating the ability to calculate material strengths of 3D weaves.  Strength predictions will be made for two different 3D woven hybrid preform reinforced phenolic panels and compared to measured test data for validation."
"The proposed project builds upon the work done in Phase I with the development of a C-SiC CMC honeycomb material that was successfully tested for mechanical properties at both ambient and high temperature.  The further study expands to include the development of an SiC-SiC honeycomb using the proven infiltration process of the Phase I project.  In the proposed project, an SiC prepreg will be engineered that can be formed into a honeycomb and then infiltrated with SiC to form a ceramic SiC-SiC honeycomb.  The honeycomb will then be tested mechanically at ambient temperature and high temperature.  This testing will include cycling the material to determine property falloff.  C-SiC and SiC SiC will be compared in this study.  The thermal characteristics, such as conductivity and emissivity, will also be tested.  The integration of such a material into hypersonic and other structures is a key area of the research; therefore a bonding study is included in the current proposal.  Several bonding technologies and processes will be investigated and tested mechanically as well as cycled to determine durability.  The goal of the study is to provide a sandwich level technology that can be integrated into hypersonic vehicle structures and acreage."

"This is the wide-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the wide-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-100 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track. Geolocations in the original product, however, are subsampled at 5-km, and thus the crosss-track width of the subset geolocations is 41 pixels. The subset Cloud Mask has 201 pixels across-track. However, some of the Cloud Mask information is at bit level, thus allowing storing actually 250-m information in seemingly 1-km pixels. This is achieved by reserving 2 bytes (the last two out of six) of every 1-km pixel as 16 yes/no-cloud bits. Each one of these 16 bits flags a corresponding 250-m tile inside the 1-km pixel. Their state is described in the local attributes to the Cloud_Mask HDF data set, and accordingly must be interprated as 0=YES, 1=NO. Thus the effective cross-track width, for these two bytes only, is 804 tiles of 250-m denomination. 
      
Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.
      
In the standard product, the MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime & nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the  visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality.

"Metabolic networks have scale free topologies, quite different from random networks and suggestive of underlying rules that govern their assembly and expansion. While many insights have emerged through theoretical and computational modeling of metabolism, few studies have focused explicitly on analyzing the evolution of metabolic communities, particularly those found in extreme environments. In this study we combine network analysis of metagenomic data sets from environments such as Yellow Stone National Park with the development of novel computational models to investigate how metabolic communities evolve in response to catalytic innovation. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) Build computational models to investigate network evolution of metabolic communities.  (2) Identify the network architecture and patterns of diversity for metagenomes, and (3) Utilize computational models as a predictive framework for testing novel hypothesis about the structure and evolution of metabolic communities, particularly in extreme environments. Our methods include building computational models of multilevel evolution of chemical reaction networks using kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms with codes developed in Python. Results will be compared to networks inferred from 1) whole genomes and 2) metagenomes of complex microbial communities, which will be analyzed using techniques from network and graph theory. Our proposal is directly relevant to exobiology. In particular, our research proposal addresses the first of the three basic questions emphasized in the NASA Astrobiology Roadmap: 'how does life begin and evolve?' Our project will directly contribute to four of the roadmap objectives identified under three of its seven goals. This includes Goal 4 to 'Understand how life on Earth and its planetary environment have co-evolved through geological time'. In particular, we will address Objective 4.2 aimed at understanding the 'Production of complex life' by investigating the pathways by which metabolic networks expand and evolve to permit increasingly complex ecosystems. We will also address Goal 5, to 'Understand the evolutionary mechanisms and environmental limits of life' with this project. By characterizing the evolution of the network structure and diversity of metabolic communities (including those in extreme environments such as Yellow Stone National Park) our proposed research will specifically contribute to Objective 5.2, addressing the 'Co-evolution of microbial communities' and Objective 5.3, addressing 'Biochemical adaptation to extreme environments'. Finally, our project furthers Goal 6 to 'Understand the principles that will shape the future of life, both on Earth and beyond' by answering the call in Objective 6.1 to address the 'Effects of environmental changes on microbial ecosystems'. We do so by developing predictive models that integrate biogeochemistry with adaptation by microbial ecosystems through our utilization of environmental metagenomic data sets in the construction of our computational model systems. More specific to this funding opportunity, our project precisely conforms to the NASA Exobiology area of emphasis in 'Early Evolution of Life and the Biosphere'. Our project will directly contribute to objective (iv) in this opportunity to ``study the coevolution of microbial communities, and the interactions within such communities, that drive major geochemical cycles, including the processes through which new species are added to extant communities'' by detailing the mechanisms underlying the expansion of chemical networks in metabolic communities. The results of our study will also be relevant to 'Biosignatures and Life Elsewhere' under by providing a novel computational framework for understanding the multilevel evolution of metabolic reaction networks that will ``constrain or extend concepts of possible chemical evolution relevant to the origin, evolution, and distribution of life.''"

"Prediction and enhancement of vehicle interior noise due to high frequency excitation, based on computer simulation, allows the application of the technology at the early stage of design process thereby improving the quality and reducing the cost. Traditionally, Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) has been used for this  purpose. Modeling of SEA is rather complex and requires high level of analyst expertise as well as occasional testing of the product's components. In this proposal, a comprehensive Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFEA) software will be developed for the evaluation of vehicle interior noise. Since the low frequency noise and vibration modeling is traditionally performed using finite element method, the development of an EFEA software will provide a unified framework for the both the low and high frequency noise and vibration analyses."

"Hall thrusters are being considered for many space missions because their high specific impulse delivers a larger payload mass fraction than chemical rockets. With a low thrust, however, Hall thrusters need to operate for a long period of time to achieve the necessary velocity of the mission. For these missions, the lifetime requirements can reach into tens of thousands of hours. For Hall thrusters, the most important life-limiting process is the erosion of the channel walls. However, experimental verification of lifetime is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, computational method is a useful tool to predict thruster lifetime. Many of the Hall thruster lifetime models were developed, and some of theses models gave quite promising results. However, while qualitatively interesting, the results did not match well with experiment. The reason of this discrepancy is that these numerical models assume electrons as a fluid. The proposed innovation will provide a better understanding of the erosion physics and will be useful for future Hall thruster development, such as HiVHAc, with low cost and time. This tool also will allow to aid in the acceptance and implementation of Hall thrusters as a primary propulsion device through improving confidence of their long term reliability."

"The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) NASA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo Model Parameters (VNP43IA1) Version 1 product provides kernel weights (parameters) at 500 meter (m) resolution. The VNP43IA1 product is produced daily using 16 days of VIIRS data, temporally weighted to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The VNP43IA1 product provides three spectrally dependent kernel weights, also known as model parameters: isotropic (fiso), volumetric (fvol), and geometric (fgeo), which can be used to model anisotropic effects of the Earth’s surface. All VNP43 data products are designed to promote the continuity of NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo data product suite. 

The VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from VNP43IA1 to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry (VNP43IA4) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43IA4.001), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) (VNP43IA3) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43IA3.001). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial, to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle. Likewise, both the BSA and WSA Science Dataset (SDS) layers can be used with a simple polynomial, to manually estimate instantaneous actual albedo (blue-sky albedo). Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/194/VNP43_ATBD_V1.pdf).

The system solution for conventional seals represents a compromise between the turbopump mechanical design, primarily flowpath, and secondary flowpath design that results in increased leakage, increased seal wear, and reduced balance piston load capacity that reduces performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  The magnetically actuated seal eliminates this compromise and provides significant improvement in performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  Phase 1 will advance the technology from TRL 2 to 3.  Phase 2 will advance the technology from TRL 3 to 6.  The technology is applicable to booster engines, in-space engines, and lunar engines."

The Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.

The retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI HCHO from ultraviolet spectral measurements is the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The relevant information of absorption cross section, instrument characteristics, cloud cover as well as aerosol index are utilized to derive HCHO slant column density (SCD). The air mass factor (AMF) Look-up table has been created with the VLIDORT 2.6 radiative transfer model at the wavelength of 340 nm, and the AMF is used to compute the total column averaging kernels (AK). The background normalization of the slant columns is essential for weak absorbent like formaldehyde to compensate for possible systematic offsets. The main outputs of the DOAS algorithm are the vertical column density (VCD), SCD, AMF, uncertainty, AK, and quality flags."

"In order to avoid an unintended failure in proposed Solar Sail spacecraft due to solarelastic interactions it is important to develop an analytical framework for predicting the interaction between the solar pressure and the solar membrane. I will develop a fully coupled membrane, solar pressure model that can be used to predict dynamic instabilities for Solar Sails. Many of the techniques will be directly borrowed from supersonic aeroelastic analysis but the analysis will specifically focus on proposed Solar Sails. Specifically I will couple a solar pressure model proposed by MacNeal [1] with finite element structural model of the Solar Sail to determine the critical dimensions for different solar pressure strengths. Furthermore, I will conduct non-linear structural analysis for the sails to determine the post critical behavior and ensure that the stress induced by flutter will not cause catastrophic sail failure.

In addition I will validate my theoretical model with experimentation. Because the solar pressure will not be measurable on the ground where aerodynamic forces will dominate, alternate methods of simulating the solarelastic response will be developed. For my research I will use piezoelectric patches to simulate the generalized forces in the most important structural modes. The most important structural modes will be determined by the unstable eigenvalues in the solarelastic analysis and the critical mode shape from the corresponding eigenfuctions. As with the theoretical analysis, initial simulations will be done on the simply supported rectangle case.

"Model calculations and risk assessment estimates indicate that secondary neutrons, with energies ranging between 0.5 to >150 MeV, make a significant contribution to the total absorbed dose received by space crews during long duration space missions [1-3]. Advanced scintillation materials, which exhibit radiation type and mass dependent emission times, coupled to SSPM detectors, provide the optimum volume to payload performance and the ability to easily discriminate between the fraction of dose, which results from secondary neutrons, and that which results from exposure to energetic charged particles and background gamma-rays.
The Phase-1 effort successfully characterized the critical components of the proposed dosimeter, specifically, the response of the scintillation material to irradiation by gamma-rays, protons, and neutrons, as well as the performance of the SSPM detector.  The Phase-1 modeling studies provide a critical foundation for assessing the anticipated signals in the space radiation environment. The proposed dosimeter would overcome many of the limitations in the current generation of neutron dosimeters, and would provide baseline information on the physics, needed with the information from biological studies, to assess risk in future human-space-exploration missions to the moon and Mars."

"The Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) presented in this paper is an
innovative solution for non-intrusively monitoring the state of health (SoH) and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of electronic and electromechanical assets by accessing and processing data obtained from a standard avionics data bus. To support Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring (IVHM) initiatives, the solution being described here has been designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. An innovative, model-driven anomaly diagnostic and fault characterization system for electromechanical actuator (EMA) systems was developed to mitigate potentially catastrophic faults. EMA systems are used in a wide variety of aircraft applications to control critical components such as control surfaces, landing gear and thrust vector control. Failure in any one of these systems can compromise passenger safety, as well as mission success. A MIL-STD-1553 bus interface and monitor were designed to extract environmental (e.g., altitude, air speed, air density) and operational (i.e., response of system to a commanded change) data of a representative EMA system and to determine whether an anomaly is detected, and the corresponding severity. The MIL-STD-1553 bus was chosen as the test bed to develop this approach, due to its large installed base and availability of compatible development tools. Advanced and unique reasoning methodologies are applied to the extracted data sets to provide anomaly detection and fault classification on various fault modes and eventually yield SoH and RUL. In this paper we describe a data monitoring unit that will, in real time, identify, isolate, and characterize faults and establish their severity so that major performance problems can be alleviated. When built, this system will consist of a laptop with a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) card slot that can accept multiple interfaces to the MAPR software package. The MAPR package will be designed to be adaptable for a large number of different platforms, for portability and for maximum input data type flexibility. This paper describes a ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method."

Completed during summer 2019, FIREX-AQ utilized a combination of instrumented airplanes, satellites, and ground-based instrumentation. Detailed fire plume sampling was carried out by the NASA DC-8 aircraft, which had a comprehensive instrument payload capable of measuring over 200 trace gas species, as well as aerosol microphysical, optical, and chemical properties. The DC-8 aircraft completed 23 science flights, including 15 flights from Boise, Idaho and 8 flights from Salina, Kansas. NASA’s ER-2 completed 11 flights, partially in support of the FIREX-AQ effort. The ER-2 payload was made up of 8 satellite analog instruments and provided critical fire information, including fire temperature, fire plume heights, and vegetation/soil albedo information.

"NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

This data product, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree monthly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 19, 2019.  The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.

The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update.  

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.

If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data."

"The objective of this research is to create a generic advanced Flight Management System (FMS) platform that could be used for evaluation of autonomous trajectory-based operation concepts. The research addresses the following deficiencies: most FMSs have limited advanced features; are specific to a single aircraft type; expensive and protected by FMS manufacturers. The proposed FMS platform will enable users to deploy a wide array of autonomy enabling FMS features by the click of a button. Some of the proposed features include: (i) air-ground & inter-aircraft trajectory negotiation, (ii) 4D Trajectory-Based Operations (4DTBO), (iii) high-fidelity wind modeling for improved predictability, (iii) trajectory planning options based on environmental and efficiency considerations, and (iv) advanced guidance modes such as Required Time of Arrival (RTA) and 4DFMS. A key feature of the proposed research is the integration of this platform and its features with NASA's Multi-AirCraft Simulation (MACS) platform.

Phase I research will identify the complete array of features for possible inclusion in this platform. Moreover, Phase I will demonstrate select features through the interface to MACS. Phase II research will elevate the technology readiness level suitable for deployment in Human-In-The-Loop simulation pilot stations."

"By the end of this year, we intend to have a two inch diameter, operational test article which continuously generates a symmetric plasma discharge. We intend to ensure this symmetry by adding a magnet to the original one inch diameter design which was used to demonstrate this shock wave attenuation effect in an earlier wind tunnel test. We will be testing a slightly larger model in order to better instrument the test article. This larger model will also add to our understanding of how the size of the model affects the amount of power needed to attenuate the shock waves. We also intend to demonstrate that the discharge from this new model significantly attenuates any shock waves generated at flight relevant conditions in a supersonic wind tunnel. The next step after this year is to mount this test article to the ""Big Red"" flight test fixture underneath a NASA F15, fly at Mach 1.6 at 31kft, 32kft and 33kft and possibly Mach 1.8 at 33kft.

"To date, the majority of the gearboxes used on the rovers have been based on very conventional materials, process and designs.  This has primarily been a result of the fast paced schedules associated with rover development.  With little time for recovery, these programs are extremely risk adverse and the idea of developing new technology on the program is absolutely impractical.  As there is no rover planned for the 2007 there is a longer than normal dwell between rover programs.  The hope is to capitalize on this time to advance the technology used on the common gearboxes employed on the rover.  This will allow new technology to be introduced into the gearbox designs.  
The plan for reducing the gearbox mass relies on a three pronged approach.  First, design innovations above and beyond AGMA standards will be evaluated for incorporation into the basic planetary gearbox design.  Second, advanced materials and processes will be evaluated for use in gears and planet bearings.  And lastly, the cost implications of the advanced technology will be compiled to insure the correct balance is maintained between weight reduction and cost expense."

"We have developed a prototype instrument called “Standoff Biofinder” which is able to detect biomolecules and bio-markers from a collection of rocks and minerals in a large area with detection time of 0.1 s. The Standoff Biofinder takes advantage of the short lifetime of bio-fluorescent materials to obtain real-time images showing the locations of biological materials among luminescent minerals in a geological context. The instrument works in daylight as well as nighttime conditions and bio-detection capability is not affected by the background light. The Standoff Biofinder instrument will be suitable for locating fluorescent polyaromatic hydrocarbons, amino acids, proteins, bacteria, biominerals, photosynthetic pigments, and diagenetic products of microbial life both on dry landscapes as well as on Ocean Worlds of the outer Solar System (e.g., Enceladus, Europa, and Titan).
	At present, the images provided by the prototype biofinder are black and white images displaying the morphology and concentrations of biological molecules. In this proposal, we propose to develop the next generation of the instrument, “Compact Color Biofinder” (CoCoBi) which will provide color fluorescent images of biological species in a target area.  One of the advantages of the color biofinder over the present biofinder system would be ability to differentiate multiple biological materials in a target area which may contain a mixture of biological species in various concentrations. CoCoBi will be helpful in identifying the biological materials based on their fluorophore colors, along with morphologies and concentrations.  In addition, the color-biofinder will be significantly miniaturized in size and will be an ideal “search for life” future mission instrument. CoCoBi will be designed to look for ppm levels of biomaterial from a standoff distance of several centimeters in a geological setting, as well as in water and ice, with detection time less than 1 s. An important feature of the Standoff Biofinder instrument is its capability to detect biomolecules which are deeper in water and ice, without sample collection. The CoCoBi instrument will be useful for locating a biological material during future NASA rover, lander, and crewed missions to Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Enceladus, Europa, Titan, asteroids etc. Additionally, the instrument can be used for non-contact, non-destructive detection of biological materials in priceless samples obtained from sample return missions from other planets and asteroids.
	Under this project, the TRL of the proposed compact color biofinder instrument will advance from TRL 2 to TRL 4."
"This project will develop a much-needed multidisciplinary analysis tool for predicting the impact of aeroelastic effects on the functionality of inflatable aeroassist vehicles in both the continuum and rarefied flow regimes.  In this integrated multi-physics multi-disciplinary computing environment,  high-fidelity modules for continuum and rarefied aerodynamics, stress, heat transfer, and computational grid deformation are coupled. This flexible and extensible approach allows the integration of state-of-the-art, stand-alone NASA and industry leading continuum and rarefied flow solvers and structural analysis codes into a computing environment in which the modules can run concurrently with synchronized data transfer. 

The Phase I study proved the feasibilty of this approach. Tightly coupled fluid-structure continuum flow demonstrations were conducted on a clamped ballute configuration. The feasibility of implementing a DSMC flow solver in the simulation framework was demonstrated, and loosely coupled rarefied flow aeroelastic demonstrations were performed. A NASA and industry technology survey identified several software tools for fluid and structural modeling to be integrated into the environment. Phase II efforts will focus on full implementation of these tools. They include NASA-selected CFD and DSMC codes, and commercial leading structural analysis codes capable of modeling non-linear shape and material response of thin-film inflated aeroshells. Extensive verification and validation studies will be performed, and the software will be applied in ballute technology development."
"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."

"For billions of years, Bacteria and Archaea have formed organized communities in microbial mats. Such cooperation among microbes has played determinative roles in the persistence of life, and provides insight into how life on Earth and elsewhere may respond to and evolve in extreme conditions. 
  A key cooperative mechanism among cells in high density habitats is quorum sensing (QS) using cell-to-cell signals. Genetic evidence suggests QS evolved 3.4 GYA, and was likely important during life's early evolution when extreme environments prevailed. However, QS has not been explored in an astrobiology context, nor in astrobiologically relevant extreme environments, where deep branching microbial lineages thrive. This paucity of data presents a critical knowledge gap.
  We propose to investigate QS in microbial mats in hypersaline systems and lava caves, both analogs of habitats believed to have been present on early Earth and Mars; both also host deep-branching Archaea and Bacteria. Our main hypothesis is that QS signaling contributes to microbial-survival and resiliency under multiple extreme conditions. We will focus specifically on genetic components of QS, and how they drive gene expression during changing extreme conditions. Doing so will establish a solid foundation for understanding QS in mats in extreme environments, analogs of which thrived in early life on Earth. QS is a fundamental life process leading to higher organization and also a critical pathway through which microbes tolerate and adapt to environmental extremes similar to those that prevailed on early Earth and Mars. 
  Objective 1: QS occurs in extreme environments: hypersaline mats and Hawaiian lava caves. H1: QS occurs among phylogenetically diverse Bacteria and Archaea in extreme environments. Acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are well-studied signaling molecules that confer important metabolic properties on microbes, but their diversity and activities in microbes in extreme environments are poorly understood. AHL signaling comprises a conserved AHL and a receptor protein (i.e., luxR homolog). Our preliminary data show the presence of AHLs in hypersaline mats. However, additional work is needed to determine if AHL-based QS systems are common in microbial communities in extreme environments. We will investigate genetic bases of AHL-QS and phylogenetic diversities of luxR homologs as possible mechanisms of adaptability in these communities.
	Objective 2: QS confers and enhances survivability under changing extremes in early Earth- and early Mars-like environments. H2: Both the types of signals used by Archaea and Bacteria and resulting gene expression, change as conditions (salinity, desiccation, UV) become more extreme. We posit from our preliminary results that certain signals are less susceptible to degradation than shorter-chain counterparts. We thus predict that cells will utilize more-resilient signals under harsh environmental conditions. This in turn will test the potential for life to adapt to changing environmental extremes, and its implications for life elsewhere. To do so, we will determine changes in levels of gene expression, concentrations and types of AHLs in natural, multi-species mats, and in isolates exposed to varying extreme environmental conditions (high UV CO2, desiccation, salinity) in both a Planetary Environmental Liquid Simulator (PELS) and controlled atmosphere chamber.
	Objective 3:  AHL signals persist over time through extreme environmental changes. H3: QS signals are preserved under extreme conditions (high salinity, desiccation, UV). This contributes to recovery and persistence of cooperative processes in mats. Our preliminary studies show that extracellular osmolytes protect AHLs in natural hypersaline mats during desiccation and UV exposure. When more favorable conditions return, this may elicit community-wide recovery rather than just individual cell survival, and enhance community survival over long periods."
"The objective of this project is to improve human-robot interaction (HRI) in order to enhance the capability of NASA critical missions. This research will focus two top challenges identified by the NASA RTA panel: improving the understanding and expressing of intent between humans and robots and creating supervised autonomous HRI loops. To address these challenges, this proposal will explore the design space of inferring human intent and cognitive state and the design space of improving robot feedback.

This proposal will utilize cutting-edge brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to aid robots in inferring user intent and cognitive state. Recent improvements in BCI allow for the continuous passive monitoring of human features such as attention and cognitive load via low-cost wireless headsets with no need for extra training. Robots armed with such knowledge will improve collaborative control by knowing when it is best to interrupt their human partners to request aid and gaining further contextual task-based knowledge. This information will be combined with other robotic sensors to increase robot understanding of human intent.

This research will also work towards improving the communication channel whereby robots convey information back to human partners. To this end, this research will leverage advances in social and cognitive psychology to imbue robots with the knowledge of and ability to use social cues. These cues, such as gestures and eye gaze, will enhance human-robot collaborative work regardless of task domain by creating more fluid and effective interactions.

Overall, this research will make practical and appreciable gains to NASA's robotic systems by creating closed-loop, intuitive, minimal error human-robot interactions."

"The TCSP TICOSONDE-AURA 2005 dataset consists of 4 soundings per day (00, 06, 12, and 18 UT) launched from Juan Santamaria International Airport, WMO station 78762, latitude 10 degrees N and 84.2 degrees W. The launch program began at 00 UT on 16 June 2005 and ended 00 UT 24 August 2005. With a very few exceptions, the sondes were Vaiasala model RS92-SGP and the ground station was a DigiCORA MW11 equipped for GPS wind-finding and upgraded for RS92 telemetry. A small number of ascents were made with RS90-AG and RS80-15G sondes. Most ascents were done with 500-g latex balloons filled with hydrogen. Exceptions included 24 ascents at 06 and 18UT in July that were piggybacked on a larger payload consisting of the University of Colorado Cryogenic Frostpoint Hygrometer (CFH) and an ECC ozonesonde. Median termination altitude for all ascents was approximately 26 km. Data were recorded at the maximum MW11 sample rate of one every two seconds. The TCSP mission collected data for research and documentation of cyclogenesis, the interaction of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind and air pressure that creates ideal birthing conditions for tropical storms, hurricanes and related phenomena. The goal of this mission was to help us better understand how hurricanes and other tropical storms are formed and intensify."

"The MODIS/Aqua Level 1B Subsampled Calibrated Radiance 5Km (MYD02SSH) product is a subsample from the MODIS Level 1B 1-km data. Every fifth pixel is taken from the MYD021KM product and written out to MYD02SSH. The subsampling starts at the third frame, and at the third line. Here, ""frame"" and ""line"" are naming conventions for pixels along and across the scan, respectively. Since MYD02SSH is a subsampled Level 1B product, many things from the Level 1B documentation apply as well. The MYD02SSH data product contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 bands generated from MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance (MOD 01). The radiance units are in W/(m ^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data. Visible, shortwave infrared (SWIR), and Near Infrared (NIR) measurements are made during daytime only, while radiances for Thermal Infrared (TIR) are measured continuously. 

As its parent, the MYD02SSH is in HDF-EOS format, and all metadata structures and names are preserved for better convenience. However, some relevant changes are made where appropriate (e.g., the dimension mappings are updated to reflect the new one-to-one correspondence between the data and geolocations). The latter is one of the most important differences: in the MYD02SSH, there is no offset between data and geolocation pixels. The spatial coverage is almost similar to that from MYD021KM (nominally it is 2330 by 2030 km, cross-track by along-track, respectively). The MYD02SSH is produced continuously, and thus the processing provides 2-day repeat observations of the Earth with a repeat orbit pattern every 16 days.

"This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Ultra-Rapid Orbit Product (daily files, generated daily) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS ultra-rapid combined orbit products. The ultra-rapid orbit and clock combination is a sub-daily solution, released four times per day, at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC (prior to GPS week 1267 they were released twice daily). In this way the average age of the predictions is reduced to 6 hours (compared to 36 hours for the old IGS predicted products and 9 hours for the twice-daily ultra-rapid solutions). IGS ultra-rapid orbit files contain 48 hours of tabulated orbital ephemerides, and the start/stop epochs continuously shift by 6 hours with each update. The first 24 hours of each IGS ultra-rapid orbit are based on the most recent GNSS observational data from the IGS hourly tracking network. At the time of release, the observed orbits have an initial latency of 3 hours. The next 24 hours of each file are predicted orbits, extrapolated from the observed orbits. The orbits within each ultra-rapid product file are, however, continuous at the boundary between the observed and predicted parts. Normally, the predicted orbits between 3 and 9 hours into the second half of each ultra-rapid orbit file are most relevant for true real time applications. All orbit solution files utilize the extended standard product-3 (SP3c) format. The reduced latency on availability of these products allows for significantly improved orbit predictions and reduced errors for user applications."

"Day and night spatially gridded (L3) global NASA skin sea surface temperature (SST) products from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite.  Average daily, weekly (8 day), monthly and annual skin SST products are available at both 4.63 and 9.26 km spatial resolution. Terra was launched by NASA on December 18, 1999, into a sun synchronous, polar orbit with a daylight descending node at 10:30 am, to study the global dynamics of the Earth atmosphere, land and oceans. The MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands at a variety of spatial resolutions. Two SST products can be present in these files. The first is a skin SST produced for both day and night observations, derived from the long wave IR 11 and 12 micron  wavelength channels, using a modified nonlinear SST algorithm intended to provide continuity with SST derived from heritage and current NASA sensors. At night, a second SST product is produced using the mid-infrared 3.95 and 4.05 micron  channels which are unique to MODIS; the SST derived from these measurements is identified as SST4. The SST4 product has lower uncertainty, but due to sun glint can only be produced at night. To generate the L3 products the L2 pixels are binned into an integerized sinusoidal area grid (ISEAG) and mapped into an equidistant cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre) projection.  Additional projection detailed can be found at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/format/ The NASA MODIS L3 SST data products are generated by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) Peter Minnett and his team at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) are responsible for sea surface temperature algorithm development, error statistics and quality flagging.

"This dataset (TOVSADNH) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-11 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.

The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.

The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).

There are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs).

"Here we propose the ""Reflight of the Stratospheric TeraHertz Observatory: STO-2"". STO-2 will address a key problem in modern astrophysics, understanding the Life Cycle of the Interstellar Medium (ISM).  STO-2 will survey approximately Â? of the Southern Galactic plane in the dominant interstellar cooling line [CII] (158 Âµm) and the important star formation tracer [NII] (205 Âµm). With ~1 arcminute angular resolution, STO-2 will spatially resolve atomic, ionic and molecular clouds out to 10 kpc. Taking advantage of its enhanced, extended lifetime cryogenic receivers, the STO-2 survey will be conducted at unparalleled sensitivity levels.  STO-2 will uniquely probe the pivotal formative and disruptive stages in the life cycle of interstellar clouds and the relationship between global star formation rates and the properties of the ISM.  Combined with previous HI and CO surveys, STO-2 will create 3-dimensional maps of the structure, dynamics, turbulence, energy balance, and pressure of the Milky Way's ISM, as well as the star formation rate.  Once we gain an understanding of the relationship between ISM properties and star formation in the Milky Way, we can better interpret observations of nearby galaxies and the distant universe.  The mission goals for these surveys are to: 

•	Determine the life cycle of Galactic interstellar gas.
•	Study the creation and disruption of star-forming clouds in the Galaxy.
•	Determine the parameters that affect the star formation rate in the galaxy.
•	Provide templates for star formation and stellar/interstellar feedback in other galaxies.   

STO-2 will re-use the 80cm telescope, gondola, and subsystems from STO-1.  For the STO-2 flight, STO-1's high spectral resolution (<1 km/s) heterodyne receiver system will be upgraded for extended cryogenic lifetime, enhanced sensitivity, and greater reliability.  The flight receiver has eight, cryogenic HEB mixers; four optimized for the [CII] line and four for the [NII] line.  STO-2 will also fly an uncooled, Schottky receiver to observe the 609 Âµm [CI] line at 3 arcminute resolution. The instrument spectrometer has sufficient bandwidth to detect all clouds participating in Galactic rotation in each of its 9 pixels. STO is capable of detecting every giant molecular cloud, every HII region of significance, and every diffuse HI cloud with (AV â‰¥ 0.4) within its survey region. 

The STO-1 launch was on 15 January 2012. Before achieving float altitude a frozen absolute pressure regulator vented approximately half of the liquid helium supply to the atmosphere. This event reduced the cryogenic (THz) portion of the mission to ~5 days. The efficacy of the observations conducted during this period was hindered by several technical issues experienced early in the flight. The causes of these issues were identified and corrected in flight. STO then transitioned into its `Warm Mission' science program and continued observations using an uncooled 492 GHz [CI] receiver until the end of its flight on 29 January 2012. Here we propose to re-fly STO with an upgraded, more robust cryogenic/receiver system that will allow THz observations to continue until stratospheric conditions or recovery constraints require terminating the mission (up to ~60 days).  STO-2 will benefit tremendously from the heritage and experience gained during the STO-1 campaign."
"Previous research described the use of machine learning algorithms to predict aircraft fuel consumption. This technique, known as Virtual Sensors, models fuel consumption as a function of aircraft Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data. FOQA data consist of a large number of measurements that are already recorded by many commercial airlines. The predictive model is used for anomaly detection in the fuel consumption history by noting when measured fuel consumption exceeds an expected value. This exceedance may indicate overconsumption of fuel, the source of which may be identified and corrected by the aircraft operator. This would reduce both fuel emissions and operational costs. This paper gives a brief overview of the modeling approach and describes efforts to validate and analyze the initial results of this project. We examine the typical error in modeling, and compare modeling accuracy against both complex and  simplistic regression approaches. We also estimate a ranking of the importance of each FOQA variable used as input, and demonstrate that FOQA variables can reliably be used to identify different modes of fuel consumption, which may be useful in future work. Analysis indicates that fuel consumption is accurately predicted while remaining theoretically sensitive to sub-nominal pilot inputs and maintenance-related issues."

"The Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) level 2 High-Energy Particle Spectrometer (HEPS) A daily product contains electron high-resolution spectral data converted to number intensity units from the HEPS telescopes mounted on the zenith UARS boom. PEM was flown on the UARS spacecraft to measure the type, amount, energy, and distribution of charged particles injected into the Earth's thermosphere, mesosphere, and stratosphere.

The PEM HEPS electron data covers roughly the energy range from 35 keV to 5 MeV. There are four telescopes mounted in different directions. These measure -15 deg, +15 deg, +45 deg, and +90 degrees with respect to the spacecraft -z-axis and along the spacecraft +x-axis. The HEPS electron units accumulate a spectrum in 4.086 seconds. There are two HEPS units in these data product files (labeled HEPS1 and HEPS2), each containing two telescopes (labeled telescope 1 and telescope 2). Each telescope contains a stack of solid state crystals. The signals from each of the crystals are combined by energy processing electronics of the instrument to yield two logical crystals or detectors, called the DE and EE detectors. The DE detector has the rough energy range from 35 keV to 300 keV and the EE detector rough energy range is from 300 keV to 5 MeV.

There is one data file per day for the PEM HEPSA product, and the temporal coverage is from Oct. 1, 1991 to Aug. 23, 2005. Spatial coverage for the HEPSA product ranges between -57 and +57 degrees latitude. The HEPSA data files are written in network binary format. For more information please review the PEM HEPSA data format guide."

"The goal of the proposed work is the development of a portable and efficient pulsed laser system for LIDAR and ranging applications, which make use of the latest developments in fiber optic technology. Even though there have been significant advances in fiber lasers, there is still a need for development of a reliable fiber laser system generating nanosecond and sub nanosecond  (100 ps ? 5 ns) pulses with enough energy for ranging applications. The potential applications of such a laser would be LIDAR systems that are flown in smaller UAV platforms where size and efficiency are key requirements. The proposed laser system follows the classical arrangement of a Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA). The master oscillator consists of a microchip laser which is a commercially off the shelf (COTS) component. The power amplifier will be constructed using photonic crystal fiber (PCF).  Due to the many developments over the last few years in the area of fiber optic technologies and components, Phase I work will start with an in-depth evaluation of all available technologies, which will lead to the design and development of a space-worthy high power nanosecond laser."

"Prognostics is an emerging science of predicting the health condition of a system (or its components) based upon current and previous system states. A reliable predictor is very useful to a wide array of industries to predict the future states of the system such that the maintenance service could be scheduled in advance when needed. In this paper, an adaptive recurrent neural network (ARNN) is proposed for system dynamic state forecasting. The developed ARNN is constructed based on the adaptive/recurrent neural network architecture and the network weights are adaptively optimized using the recursive Levenberg-Marquardt (RLM) method. The effectiveness of the proposed ARNN is demonstrated via an application in remaining useful life prediction of lithium-ion batteries.*"

"Sentinel-1 SLC interferometric products generated by JPL using ISCE v2.0.0, delivered by ASF"
"The objective of this limited edition data collection is to examine products generated by the CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm to analyze Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.
 
The CLIMCAPS algorithm is based on the NUCAPS (NOAA Unique CrIS/ATMS Processing System) Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-prior first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data.

Cloud clearing is the process of computing the clear column radiance for a given channel n, and represents what the channel would have observed if the entire scene were cloud free. The entire scene is defined as the ATMS field of regard (FOR) which includes and array of 3x3 CrIS field of views (FOV). The basic assumption of cloud-clearing is that if the observed radiances in each field-of-view are different, the differences in the observed radiances are solely attributed to the differences in the fractional cloudiness in each field of view while everything else (surface properties and atmospheric state) is uniform across the field of regard. 

The CLIMCAPS system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system. For comparison, the AIRS/AMSU data collection AIRI2CCF contains similar meteorological information to this CLIMCAPS data collection and the CHART (Climate Heritage AIRS Retrieval Technique ) data collection SNDRSNIML2CHTCCRN contains CRIMSS data processed with an analogous algorithm. A level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day."
"RF MEMS for Space-Based Radar Applications, Phase I"
"The proposed innovation is a methodology for advanced process control and deposition analysis built around using signals generated by beam-component interactions in the Electron Beam Free Form Fabrication (EBF3) system. These signals have the potential to be used for many forms of both metrology and process control. While many material properties might be studied by using this interaction, our initial focus is an investigation into beam and sensor characteristics for geometric analysis of the deposition.    Signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material, as it is being deposited. This is important, as the ability to monitor a parameter during deposition creates the possibility of controlling that parameter during the deposition process.    As a further refinement, the ability to collect and store a spatially resolved pass-by-pass map of the deposition path geometry may have value in on-the-fly adjustments to subsequent build passes. Such mapping would allow working with the layer-by-layer nature of the deposition process to fine tune the deposition geometry. Such spatially resolved, layer-by-layer deposition mapping could also be stored, giving a three dimensional mapping of the as-built deposition path geometry. This could prove valuable for component quality assurance."

"This NASA Phase I SBIR program would develop high sensitivity, high frequency nanomembrane (NM) based surface sensors for hypervelocity testing and analysis on wind tunnel models as well as operational aerospace vehicles, using SOI NM techniques in combination with our pioneering HybridSil ceramic nanocomposite materials. Such low-modulus, conformal nanomembrane sensor skins with integrated interconnect elements and electronic devices can be applied to new or existing propulsion systems for high frequency surface pressure analysis. During this program, large continuous NMs of single crystal Si, SiGe and Ge will be readily released from the engineered wafers using wet chemical etching and transferred to flexible substrates to form multi-axis surface pressure sensors and arrays. Sensors may be connected to external support instrumentation either through thin film and ribbon cable interconnects, or potentially wirelessly using RF communication directly from electronic networks incorporated into the sensor skin material."
"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."

"To meet the challenges of rapid prototyping, direct hardware fabrication, and on-the-spot repairs on the ground and on NASA space platforms, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposed a new Holographic Optical Element-Based Laser Diode Source (HOELDS) system for direct metal deposition (DMD). HOELDS uniquely combines multiple high-power laser diode bars with holographic optical elements, efficient thermal management and innovative focusing optics to achieve a 600 W, 100-micron focused spot for DMD materials processing.  The 7-kilogram, 0.1 cubic meter HOELDS system will be ten times as energy efficient as current 1000 kilogram, 20 cubic meter DMD systems, making in-space DMD processing possible for the first time. HOELDS can process aluminum, which is extremely difficult for state-of-the art DMD systems. In Phase I, POC developed a preliminary HOELDS system, theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and component specifications leading to a proof-of-concept prototype. Melting of lead-tin solder with this prototype was demonstrated at NASA Marshall Space Center. The Phase II effort will optimize the system design, optimize fabrication of the holographic optical elements, and scale up the system into a compact high-power HOELDS system prototype capable of DMD.

"X-ray observations of planetary objects provide a unique window on fundamental processes associated with the formation and evolution of individual bodies and the Solar System as a whole. Future X-ray observations for planetary science require a sensitive yet compact X-ray imaging spectrometer that can operate in in-situ missions. The proposed new type of Miniature X-ray Optics (MiXO) can finally bring highly successful Wolter-I X-ray optics to planetary science within affordable mass, power, and cost constraints.



The elemental composition of planetary bodies is of fundamental interest to planetary science and to understanding the origin, evolution and future of life in the Solar System. X-ray fluorescence, induced either by solar X-ray flux or impacting energetic ions, carries a decisive signature of surface elemental composition. X-ray observations in the 0.1-15 keV band are a unique, powerful diagnostic tool since they cover K or L-shell fluorescence lines from all but three elements, from life essential light elements to rare earth heavy elements. X-rays from solar wind charge exchange enable probes of the dynamic and energetic interaction between comets, planetary exospheres and the influence of solar wind plasma upon planetary surfaces. The proposed optics offer flexible and affordable observing opportunities and enable efficient X-ray telescope configurations that can identify the elemental composition of a wide range of planetary bodies from asteroids and comet nuclei to airless planets and satellites. High resolution imaging with MiXO can not only identify small regions with abundant organic or unusual elements but will also allow straightforward comparison between the elemental distribution and the surface topology, which can reveal the system's evolutionary and geological history such as crater-induced sub-surface grain exposure or localized volatile depletion. As X-rays are emitted from the planetary bodies through a variety of other physical processes, applications of the proposed technology reach far beyond the study of elemental composition.



This program proposes to build three prototype MiXO modules, bringing the technology from TRL 2 to 4 by its end. MiXO inherits the progress in electroformed Nickel replicated (ENR) Wolter-I optics in the past two decades and utilizes new metal/ceramic hybrid technology using Plasma Thermal Spray (PTS) to achieve lightweight X-ray optics. Its efficient light collecting capability exceeds the performance of alternative approaches in planetary science such as micro-pore optics (MPO) by a large factor (>~3). In addition, MiXO enables high angular resolution (<30 arcsec) over a wide field of view (>1 deg), improving the detection sensitivity of surface features by an order of magnitude relative to MPO. MiXO also extends X-ray imaging to higher energies (up to ~15 keV) for detection and mapping of heavy elements. The modular design of MiXO can be easily scaled from low-cost Explorer-class to small Discovery or medium class New Frontiers missions. For Flagship missions, the proposed technology will open a door for powerful, cost-effective X-ray optics that are sensitive enough to distinguish between different organic species and thus detect astrobiological evidence in Europa.



The experts in X-ray optics and telescope systems, who have been the force behind the advances in ENR X-ray optics technology, will lead the technical efforts. The prominent planetary scientists and astrophysicists will also join the efforts to guide the MiXO design optimization for planetary science. The proposed three year plan will not only demonstrate the technical feasibility and advantage of MiXO by building progressively higher performance prototypes of MiXO, but it will also enable several MiXO designs that can be readily adopted in a wide range of future planetary missions.

Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day of the retrieval period which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This CMG product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. 

MCD43C4 removes view angle effects from directional reflectances to model the values as if they were collected from a nadir view at local solar noon. These NBAR values are calculated from MCD43C1 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43C4.006). The product includes separate NBAR layers for MODIS spectral bands 1 through 7 as well as ancillary layers for quality, local solar noon, percent finer resolution inputs, snow cover, and uncertainty.

Users are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).

Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions

*	Observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.
*	MCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.
*	Better quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period. Collection 5 used only four observations per day.
*	The MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.
*	When there are insufficient high quality reflectances, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.
*	CMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid for MCD43C as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.

Important Quality Information
The incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&caseLocation=cases_data&type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products. In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1, 3, and 4 products."
"NVAP_CLIMATE_Layered-Precipitable-Water data set is designed to provide the most stable water vapor data set over time for use in climate applications. NVAP-M Climate only includes data from stable instruments that have undergone intercalibration efforts to ensure consistency between data from the same instrument flying on multiple satellite platforms.The new NVAP data sets are produced under the NASA Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program and is named NVAP-M. It supersedes the previous NVAP data set. NVAP-M continues the legacy of providing high-quality, model-independent global estimates of total column and layered water vapor. The use of improved, intercalibrated data sets and algorithms that were not available for the heritage NVAP data set results in an improved and extended water vapor data set that is stable enough for climate research and of a resolution appropriate for studies on smaller spatial and temporal scales. The true value of NVAP-M will be seen in outcomes from applied and research users of the data set in various fields. Some initial NVAP-M findings are presented in Vonder Haar et al. (2012). In addition to the time-dependent artifacts present in the previous NVAP data set, a wealth of new data has become available since the last NVAP processing in 2003. These include an additional SSM/I instrument, additional NOAA satellites, the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)-Aqua Satellite, which carries the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), as well as water vapor information from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. This extension and reprocessing effort increases the temporal coverage from 14 to 22 (1988-2009) years, making the data set more useful and consistent for investigation of the long-term trends which are hypothesized to occur as Earth warms. In addition to the long-standing daily, 1-degree gridded Total Precipitable Water (TPW) and layered Precipitable Water (PW) products, NVAP-M includes additional products geared towards different scientific needs. Three separate processing streams produced products directed towards specific research goals. These are NVAP-M Climate, designed to provide the most stable water vapor data set over time for use in climate applications, and NVAP-M Weather, designed to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution products for use in studies on shorter time scales as well as weather case studies. Additionally, an ocean-only (NVAP-M Ocean) version includes only data from the SSM/I and is intended to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets."
"There is presently poor knowledge throughout the National Airspace System (NAS) of the airport configurations currently in use at each airport.  There is even less information about expected future configuration changes.  The airport configuration is a primary factor in various airport characteristics such as arrival and departure capacities and terminal area traffic patterns.  These characteristics, in turn, are central to a variety of Air Traffic Management (ATM) decisions, such as setting arrival restrictions to avoid airborne holding.  Consequently, uncertainty about the current or future airport configuration can result in traffic management decisions that under-utilize or overload airports, resulting in unnecessary or inefficient delays.  Moreover, air carriers would make use of configuration information.  FedEx, for example, selects parking gates for arrivals to Memphis based on expected departure runways to minimize taxi congestion and time.  The proposed effort will develop an airport configuration recognition and prediction system.  The airport configuration depends on a variety of factors; Phase 1 will consider local weather, arrival and departure demand, noise restrictions, and airport-specific considerations."

For data before August 6th of 2019, please check S5P_L2__AER_AI_1 data collection.

The Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.

The TROPOMI UV Aerosol Index has been calculated based on wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in the UV spectral range where ozone absorption is weak. A residual value is calculated from measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and per-calculated theoretical reflectance for a Rayleigh scattering-only atmosphere given a wavelength pair. TROPOMI UVAI products use the classical wavelength pair of 340/380 nm, and the OMI chosen 354/388 nm pair for the long-term continuous AI record. Figure 1 shows TROPOMI UVAI of orbit# 4060."

"<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">The objective of this work is to develop millimeter wave arrays with ultra-high accuracy alignment (&lt;300nm) using hybrid aligned bonding. Currently, most submillimeter-wave array systems utilize a single pixel both for space as well as ground applications. While these approaches are workable for the near-term, they will become unsustainable as pixel count is increased. In addition, the shear mass associated with large count heterodyne arrays based on single waveguide block per chip approaches can be a challenging task. In this project, we present a 3D wafer level integration of this technology using low cost aligned direct wafer bonding at low temperature of 200<sup>0</sup>C. This wafer level integration may decrease 50-100x in both volume and mass, hence reduces thermal gradient. As of today, most of the gain fluctuations in this device are coming from thermal gradients. By reducing the size and mass of the radiometer, the thermal gradients, these devices will be able to be used in balloons, landers, overs, and any other place where a complete remote chemical laboratory might be required.</p>

"MI3MAER_2 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level 3 Component Global Aerosol Regional public Product covering a month version 2. It contains a monthly statistical summary of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) model parameters. Data collection for this product was complete in August 2007.MISR itself is an instrument designed to view Earth with cameras pointed in 9 different directions. As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the affects of sunlight on Earth, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure."

It will measure aerosol light absorption simultaneous at three spectral regions: blue, green and red. The proposed measurement technique takes advantage of the current rapid development on high-power semiconductor lasers MEMS microphones. It will eventually weigh less than 25 pounds and consume approximately 300W electrical power. It will also be capable of being remotely controlled and being operated at a variety of sampling pressure conditions for the airborne measurements. Since majority of the electronic and optical components of the proposed system are commercially available except the home-designed acoustic cells, its total manufacturing cost could be less than $20,000 per unit."

The compact laser technology is based on previously developed hybrid integration technology that enables the direct optical coupling of active and passive waveguide chips.  The integrated design proposed reduces system complexity, lowers cost and lends itself readily to array scaling.

"<p>This task follows directly from an ""A Team"" study conducted in April 2013 to identify the future space based atmospheric composition measurements required to inform future climate and air quality research, public policy, and air quality forecasting following the completion of the Aqua and Aura missions.  A group of representatives from across the atmospheric composition community at JPL participated and of the concepts proposed, the most compelling and tractable investigations – 1. developing a predictive capability for global tropospheric ozone and 2. understanding the impact of changing water vapor concentrations in the stratosphere and upper troposphere on climate -- were selected for further study through this program as promising topics around which to base a future Earth Science Decadal Survey mission. This three-year effort to develop measurement requirements for future global atmospheric composition observations needed to provide a quantitative understanding of key processes affecting atmospheric composition and its impact on climate. We further propose to advance the technology of specific low-cost instrument concepts that are suited to deliver these measurements, namely: a simplified microwave limb sounder and, depending on the results of the first year's study, either an immersed grating or Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS).  This project will lead to the generation of one or more ""white papers"" to be submitted to the upcoming Earth science decadal survey.  These will make the scientific case for the measurements and outline mission concepts for delivering the required measurements with mature technology at modest cost. There are two overall objectives: 1. Define the spatial resolutions and sensitivities required for the instruments; 2. Mature the technology for the limb sounder and the selected spectrometer. Work in the first year is focused on strengthening the case for the observations and establishing requirements for spatial resolution.  The resolution study in turn dictates the preferred implementation route for the short wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) observations (interferometer vs. grating spectrometer). Work in the second and third years centers on technology maturation for the infrared and limb microwave sensors. </p>"

"The growing use in deep space of CubeSats is driving the need for small, flexible, full-featured telecom hardware like the Iris radio. The current Iris software is rudimentary compared the NASA Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS). The software on each slice uses a simple 333 kHz loop as a basic scheduler to invoke small C elements. Changes can only be made before the radio is installed in the spacecraft, and no code updates in flight are possible without patching.

This proposal would result in software to enable simple, low-effort elaboration of new capabilities for the Iris and similar radios.

1. Telecom Abstraction Layer (TAL) implements STRS capabilities, plus the infrastructure to dynamically select waveform applications on any sort of radio. A high-speed scheduler selects apps to run, collects execution information for debug, and reconfigures the system for needed operations. The TAL can be targeted to any radio with the modification of an i/o layer.
2. Plug-in Cognition Architecture (PiCA) running on a separate slice for cognitive link services, interfaced to each radio slice via serial. Services could include downlink rate selection in response to DSN site conditions, guaranteed data delivery, relay, antenna pointing, and access negotiation. Built-atop flight-proven VML sequencing and JPL AutoNav for spacecraft navigation, easy-to-code scripts provide sophisticated timing and event response, making cognitive services easy to write and deploy, even after launch.

The longer-duration computations of the PiCA do not interfere with the high-rate waveform activities in the TAL. Both can be updated with new components at any point in the mission, allowing unprecedented flexibility to take advantage of new technologies or compensate for spacecraft idiosyncrasies.

PASDR has the potential to shorten radio development cycles and allow easy collaboration between separate developers, benefiting the community as a whole."

"This dataset provides a 28-year time series of peak greenness (NDVI) data derived from Landsat 5 TM imagery over the boreal forest region of Canada. Landsat 5 TM scenes were collected for 46 selected sidelap sites along gradients in climate, tree cover, and disturbance history from 1984 to 2011. Peak-greenness reflectance was computed for 30-m Landsat pixels using the maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) along with the normalized burn ratio (NBR) during the period between days of the year (DOY) 180 and 204. To facilitate trend analysis at each site, the NDVI and NBR data of the 30-m Landsat pixels were regridded to the coarser MODIS 500-m (463.3-m) spatial scale to reduce the effects of missing data and to enhance the significance of the trend.

"ZONA Technology, Inc. (ZONA) proposes an R\\&D effort to develop an Experimental Model Based Feedback Control (EMBFC) Framework for the flutter suppression and gust load alleviation (GLA). The resilience of the flight control law in the presence of aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic (AE/ASE) interactions can therefore be increased by the suppression of the aircraft's structural vibrations induced by the flutter mechanism and/or gust perturbation. Currently aircrafts with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid AE/ASE interactions. However, if changes in the aircraft configuration are significant, the frequencies of the flexible modes of the aircraft may be shifted and the notch filters could become totally ineffective. With the proposed EMBFC framework, the flexible dynamics can be consistently estimated via system identification algorithms and its undesirable effects is suppressed through a robust feedback control law, while the whole systems stability is being maintained.  The proposed feedback control technique will be demonstrated with SuperSonic SemiSpan Transport S4T wind tunnel model for flutter suppression and gust load alleviation."

"<p><strong>Although a large majority of the proposed systems for upper atmospheric observation of Venus have consisted of either dirigibles [34,35,36] or solar-powered heavier than air vehicles [9,10,11,12], both suffer from their own particular drawbacks and neither deal effectively with the high wind speeds. This work proposes a solution based on dynamic soaring, a proven method to extract energy from atmospheric shear that has propelled the fastest small-scale aircraft in the world, and provided the energy necessary for long-endurance low-level flights of birds across oceans [13,14,15,16,17]. A deployable unmanned aircraft system (UAS) will be designed to not only survive in the harsh wind environment of Venus, but also simultaneously perform targeted sampling of the atmosphere while continuously extracting energy, even on the dark side of the planet. The design will be based on proven dynamic soaring platforms, but will be constructed in such a manner that allows for deployment from a standard aeroshell. Additionally, an investigation will be performed to select materials and construction methods that ensure long-term survival in the corrosive cloud-top environment.</strong></p>"

The current Russian system employs hexavalent chromium, a strong oxidant and carcinogen, and sulfuric acid to stabilize urine, while the American system utilizes potassium monopersulfate, another strong oxidant, sulfuric acid, and potassium benzoate.  Urine stabilized in these respective manners requires triple and double containment, and chemical storage and handling become problematic due to the hazardous nature and low pH (1.3 -2.6) of these chemicals.  These requirements significantly increase urine pretreatment ESM.  The proposed pretreatment system consists of a simple flow-through Solid Phase Acid (SPA) bed containing sparingly soluble transition metal oxide particles for pH control, which combined with a soluble non-oxidizing biocide will provide long-term urine stabilization.  This innovative system fulfills an unmet need for safe, efficient and automated urine pretreatment for current and future NASA missions.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of this novel approach.  The Phase II project will fully develop the process, including the design and testing of deliverable hardware for urine pretreatment."

"With the goal to reduce astronaut time required to maintain experiments on the ISS and aid advances in vision processing and robotic arm control technology, TUI proposes to collaborate with NanoRacks to develop a ""Modular Advanced Networked Telerobotic Interface System"" (MANTIS) that will integrate an existing robotic arm in a NanoLabs payload on the ISS.  The MANTIS system will reducing crew member burden for performing NanoLab experiments by enabling automated and/or supervised teleoperated operation of the Plate Reader, MixStix, and other systems in the NanoRacks instruments. The MANTIS development effort will leverage an existing KRAKEN robotic arm, integrate existing hardware and develop open source software to perform experiments on the NanoRacks platform. To aid design and integration in a Model Based Design (MBD) framework this SBIR will also develop an open simulation framework and tools, leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS) environment. MANTIS will also enable advances in vision processing and arm control algorithms for the ISS by giving researchers an open software framework to develop on MANTIS.  The Phase I effort will develop a detailed design for MANTIS.  The Phase II effort will build MANTIS and mature it to TRL-6 through integrated testing with the KRAKEN arm and NanoRacks hardware aboard the ISS. NanoRacks has agreed to collaborate with us in these efforts to enable integration of MANTIS with their experiment platform, and will be our transition partner for Phase III commercialization."
"The use of eddy-current methods to detect damage in aerospace structures,and to characterize materials is well established, and is a key item to ensure that the risk of structural failures meets the strict damage tolerance requirements established by NASA. This is especially challenging when one considers that common aerospace structures are made from such disparage materials as aluminum, titanium and steel alloys, as well as carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (cfrp) and carbon-nanotube reinforced polymers (cnrp) that are seeing increased applications at NASA.  Further the structural environments can be quite complex, including compound curvatures and/or multiple layers that are fastened together, with potential damage being located in each of the multiple layers.

To address this need, Victor Technologies has developed VIC-3D(R), a comprehensive eddy-current modeling code for solving forward and inverse problems in nondestructive evaluation (NDE).  Certain problems in modeling forward and inverse problems produce huge data sets, often requiring days of computation.  In this proposal, we will enhance VIC-3D(R) for near real-time large-scale nondestructive simulations and automated data reduction/analysis of large data sets. Furthermore, we will add models to VIC-3D(R) that will allow the characterization of cnrp composites by electromagnetic means nondestructively.  The result will be the first such commercial code for characterizing advanced composites by electromagnetic means nondestructively."

"This is the narrow-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track.  The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are  within +-5 km across the CloudSat track.   I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is about 10 km cross-track.   Thus, MAC021S0 cross-track width is 11 pixels for radiances.  Geolocations in the original product, however, are subsampled at 5-km, and thus the cross-track width of the subset geolocations is 3 pixels.  Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved. 
      
In the standard product, the MODIS Level 1B data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 discrete bands located in the 0.4 to 14.4  micron region of electromagentic spectrum. These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). In addition, the Earth Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for the solar reflective bands (1-19, 26) through knowledge  of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar diffuser  data, and from the target illumination geometry). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.
      
Visible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime, while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands  20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.

"We propose to develop a compact, robust, optically-based sensor for local and remote sensing of oxygen (O2) at 1.26 µm, carbon dioxide (CO2) at 1.56 µm and other species in spectral region of up to 2ìm with accuracy of the order of 0.5 -- 1 ppm, allowing a very high out-of-band rejection of spurious solar background radiation.    This sensor will utilize a widely tunable narrowband optical filter in conjunction with a wideband optical source (sun light or a commercially available broadband source) in combination with built-in calibration laser diode to make absorption measurements as well as evaluate atmospheric parameters such as pressure, temperature and density. Proposed instrumentation can be valuable for NASAs ASCENDS program with broad scope applications in the measurement of atmospheric parameters and multi-species concentration measurement including CO2.  Instrumentation will be environmentally rugged and compact and will possess auto-calibration capabilities, fast response time (microseconds to milliseconds range) and low-power consumption.  Phase I work will involve building and characterizing a complete laboratory scale system so that a final system can be constructed in Phase II. TRL range at onset of Phase I is 2 at end 3-4; Phase 2 at onset 4 at end 5-6."
"Imagine a craft that could enter Pluto’s atmosphere at 14 km/s and deliver a 200 kg lander to the surface using aerodynamic drag and just a few kg of propellant. Pluto’s surface pressure is just 10 millionths of Earth’s, but its atmosphere is about 7 times higher than Earth’s and its volume is about 350 times the volume of Pluto itself. Over a several hundred kilometer entry distance, this ultra-low ballistic coefficient craft can dissipate over 99.999% of its initial kinetic energy, resulting in a terminal velocity comparable to or less than past planetary landers or rovers. With this architecture, the total propellant requirement for landing on Pluto is less than 3.5 kg! After making science measurements at its initial landing site, the lander switches to “hopper” mode, taking advantage of the low gravitational acceleration (0.063 gee) and a modest propellant store to literally hop, skip, and jump around the surface, sometimes kilometers at a time, investigating features of interest. The proposed concept would enable in-situ surface science at Pluto with low overall mass, a reasonable cost, and in a timeframe of about 10-15 years."
"Instantaneous volumetric flow imaging is crucial to aerodynamic development and testing.  Simultaneous volumetric measurement of flow parameters enables accurate capture of temporally dynamic or transient flow phenomena.  Nanohmics, Inc. proposes to develop a high-speed, high-resolution plenoptic lightfield flow imaging system to capture a rapid time sequence of simultaneously measured density, velocity and pressure throughout a test volume seeded for laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).  The plenoptic imager leverages Nanohmics' existing AOI Plenoptic technology based on commercial-off-the-shelf components, providing a rapid route to commercialization.  The proposed Nanohmics plenoptic flow imager is instantaneous and therefore able to capture rapidly evolving or oscillatory flow phenomena such as turbulence or vortices (unlike existing plane-scanning techniques).  Our Phase II objectives include capture rates of 200,000 Hz or more, and volumetric resolution of over one million volume elements (voxels) &#150; well beyond existing volumetric flow imaging demonstrations.  We will leverage two of Nanohmics' current core technologies: our AOI Plenoptic lightfield camera (currently at TRL 7) and our FlashLED illumination system (currently at TRL 6).  Leveraging efficient computation hardware developed for plenoptic (wavefront sensing) applications, we will extend our existing plenoptic 3D processing algorithms and to enhance the extraction of volumetric flow density, and combine these with iterative application of fluid equations to extract volumetric velocity and pressure fields.  The Phase I objective is to design and fabricate an instantaneous volumetric 3D plenoptic flow imaging system, tested in a wind tunnel seeded for laser-induced fluorescence.  The Phase II objective includes increases in speed and resolution, and advancing to TRL 7."
"This dataset provides estimates of forest canopy height and canopy height uncertainty for study areas in the Pongara National Park and the Lope National Park, Gabon. Two canopy height products are included: 1) Canopy height was derived from multi-baseline Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) data using an inversion of the random volume over ground (RVoG) model and Kapok, an open source Python library. 2) Canopy height was derived from a fusion of PolInSAR and Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) Lidar data. This dataset also includes various intermediate parameters of the PolInSAR data (including radar backscatter, coherence, and viewing and terrain geometry) which provide additional insight into the input data used to invert the RVoG model and accuracy of the canopy height estimates.

"The Electron Reflectometer Data Record (ERDR) is a time ordered series of electron measurements from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mission. Each record consists of a time tag with 19 scalar data points representing measurements of the electron flux in 19 different energy channels, ranging from 10 eV to 20 keV, with an energy resolution of 25%. Each data point is a measure of the electron flux (cm-2 sec-1 ster-1 eV-1) averaged over a 360 x 14 degree disk-shaped field of view (FOV). (Parts of this FOV are masked because of spacecraft obstructions, as described below.) During the Science Phasing Orbits (SPO), the spacecraft was in Array Normal Spin (ANS) configuration, for which the ER field of view sweeps out the entire sky (4-pi ster) every 50 minutes, which is much longer than the integration time per record (2 to 48 sec, depending on energy and telemetry rate) and much longer than most timescales of interest in Mars&apos; plasma environment."
"This digital image map of Mars is a cartographic extension of a previously released set of CD volumes containing individual Viking Orbiter Images (PDS volumes VO_1001, VO_1002, etc.). The data in the latter are pristine, in the sense that they were processed only to the extent required to view them as images. They contain the artifacts and the radiometric, geometric, and photometric characteristics of the raw data transmitted by the spacecraft. This new volume set, on the other hand, contains cartographic compilations made by processing the raw images to reduce radiometric and geometric distortions and to form geodetically controlled Mosaicked Digital Image Models (MDIMs). (Because the photometric processing used in this MDIM was oversimplified, quantitative radiometric analysis on this data is not possible.) It also contains digitized versions of an airbrushed map of Mars as well as a listing of all IAU-approved feature names."

"The paper-based manual crew procedures that formed the basis of mission management for the manned space program are being replaced by electronic procedure representations and execution engines that support adjustable autonomy. Adhering to the conventions of the legacy procedures makes procedure authoring intuitive and less error prone than approaches that require the author to program in a formal planning language. However, this approach also preserves a drawback of the paper-based procedure: inflexibility in execution due to a lack of information about constraints implicit in the procedure.

We propose to develop the Procedure Authoring with Constraints Tool (PACT), an intuitive graphical drag-and-drop and WYSIWYG authoring environment that preserves the conventions of the paper-base procedure, but adds the capability to capture timing and ordering constraints with minimal additional effort.

During this Phase I project, we will specify user interface and functional requirements, create representative use cases, design the Phase II system, and develop and evaluate a proof-of-concept prototype to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its utility and feasibility."
"Mass and volume efficient solar arrays are sought by NASA, DoD and commercial space to enable high power missions from 20-30 kW up to 300 kW. Flexible substrate arrays can have higher specific power (W/kg) and specific volume (kW/m3) than conventional arrays. Typical designs for flexible substrate arrays require a stiff boom mechanism to deploy the array and provide the deployed structure.  Graphite composite slit-tube booms are thermally stable and can enable next-generation flexible arrays by improving mass, volume, and cost. CTD has developed and demonstrated a 5cm diameter graphite composite slit-tube boom and canister designed for a 23m tether-stiffened solar array. The Stable Tubular Extendible Lock-Out Composite (STELOC) boom proposed here will feature two innovations to the composite slit-tube design that enhance stiffness. Slit-Lock interlocks the edges of the slit and Root-Lock eliminates the open section at the root of the boom when fully deployed. Combined, these innovations enable a 10cm STELOC boom that is much simpler, lighter, and stiffer than a 25cm diameter coilable longeron boom. This Phase I program will demonstrate a full length, 10cm STELOC boom including all innovative features to enhance stiffness. The program will also develop a conceptual design that meets all boom requirements provided by an identified spacecraft prime contractor for their flexible substrate array."

"The purpose of this project was to research and model human performance in unexpected workload transitions.  These situations, when addressed by fatigued astronauts, constitute worst case scenarios that require specific, in-depth investigation.  The project addressed two NASA risk areas -- the risk of performance errors due to fatigue, and the risk of poor task design.  In addition, the research provided input for the Human Automation/Robotic Interaction research area at NASA. The project conducted integrative reviews of what was known and unknown, addressed where there was insufficient or conflicting existing research or theory for adequate quantitative prediction, and combined these insights to produce a new mechanism to understand and predict performance. This last goal was accomplished through the development of a prototype model-based tool to be used by NASA human performance researchers, automation system designers, mission planners, and astronauts to evaluate predicted astronaut performance on long-duration space missions during unexpected workload transition scenarios. The tool enables users to identify the effects of astronaut fatigue, automation system design, and task factors on predicted astronaut performance in unexpected off-nominal events (e.g., automation failures or other emergencies). The tool developed in this effort, called the Space Performance Research Integration Tool (S-PRINT), leverages the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT) human performance modeling environment, and tailors it to space mission applications.   
IMPRINT was developed for the Army Research Laboratory, and is available, free of charge, to U.S. government agencies. IMPRINT includes algorithms to study performance shaping factors such as fatigue, training, and use of protective clothing with human performance models.  IMPRINT includes a sophisticated model of operator workload based on multiple resource theory.   
S-PRINT was developed based on extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses on fatigue, automation failure response, and workload overload. We systematically evaluated human-in-the-loop research to identify and quantify factors in long-term space missions that affect astronaut workload, fatigue, and performance. The results of these meta-analyses were used to update IMPRINT algorithms so they more accurately reflect space-specific conditions. In particular, the algorithms contain empirically validated models of sleep-related fatigue, automation failure management, and multitasking in workload overload situations. Further, the team conducted a series of focused human-in-the-loop studies to address specific components of performance that were not answered in the meta-analyses. The S-PRINT tool was developed so it can be used to evaluate performance in missions that are being planned or missions that are currently underway.   
The team identified two scenarios of interest for a prototype application of the tool.  The primary scenario includes a single astronaut manually controlling a robotic arm when a failure occurs in the environmental process control system.  When the astronaut notices the process control failure, s/he needs to prioritize among the different tasks.  We worked with NASA subject matter experts (SMEs) to develop human performance models that reflect those situations. The tasks combined in this specific type of situation were of sufficient complexity to be beyond the scope of previously existing models. The team conducted an empirical, human-in-the-loop validation study of the robotic and process control system tasks.  A second scenario, involving fire detection and suppression systems, was also implemented and included with the S-PRINT tool. Our scenario development and research efforts focused specifically on worst-case situations:  rapid workload transitions (e.g., automation failures, other off-nominal events) resulting in overload, with a single astronaut.     
The S-PRINT tool offers use"

"The MODIS/Terra Level 1B Subsampled Calibrated Radiances 5km (MOD02SSH) is a subsample from the MODIS Level 1B 1-km data. Every fifth pixel is taken from the MOD021KM product and written out to MOD02SSH. The subsampling starts at the third frame, and at the third line. Here, ""frame"" and ""line"" are naming conventions for pixels along and across the scan, respectively. Since MOD02SSH is a subsampled Level 1B , many things from the Level 1B documentation apply as well. That is, the MOD02SSH data product contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 bands generated from MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance (MOD01). The radiance units are in W/(m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data. Visible, shortwave infrared (SWIR), and Near Infrared (NIR) measurements are made during daytime only, while radiances for Thermal Infrared (TIR) are measured continuously. 

As its parent, the MOD02SSH is in HDF-EOS format, and all metadata structures and names are preserved for better convenience. However, some relevant changes are made where appropriate (e.g., the dimension mappings are updated to reflect the new one-to-one correspondence between the data and geolocations). The latter is one of the most important differences: in the MOD02SSH, there is no offset between data and geolocation pixels. The spatial coverage is almost similar to that from MOD021KM (nominally it is 2330 by 2030 km, cross-track by along-track, respectively). The MOD02SSH is produced continuously, and thus the processing provides 2-day repeat observations of the Earth with a repeat orbit pattern every 16 days."

"The magnetic field is a fundamental physical quantity, and its accurate measurement with absolute stability to better than 1 nT is required for many future solar system exploration missions. Future missions requiring this capability include the Europa Lander, which could resolve induction signals to characterize Europa’s sub-surface ocean; the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, which seeks to characterize Uranus’ unique offset multi-pole magnetic field; an Enceladus Orbiter; and the Lunar Geophysical Network. All of these missions require measurement of small-amplitude magnetic signals with excellent long-term stability. Europa induced magnetic fields are a few nano-Teslas in amplitude and are generated by exposure to periodic magnetic field variations resulting from the rotation of the Jovian tilted magnetic field about the planetary spin axis at a period of ~11 h and from the moon traversing the magnetic environment of its host planet in an eccentric orbit at a period of ~85 h. Magnetic sounding is already an integral investigation of the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission, and it is ideally complemented by lander observations because the induction response is sensitive to altitude so that the induction science return is greatly enhanced by combining the high-altitude flyby observations with those from the surface.
Fluxgate magnetometers alone cannot deliver the required performance because their calibration can drift so that long-term stability is not guaranteed. The proven solution is to partner the high-heritage fluxgate instruments with an absolute reference magnetometer, which serves as a calibration source. The fact is, however, that the mass and power of such instrument combination and of most atomic magnetometers alone exceed the capabilities of many planetary missions, especially those with a lander element.
To solve the resource problem, The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology have developed a novel miniature absolute scalar rubidium (Rb) magnetometer within the Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System Observations (PICASSO) program. The use of recently developed micro-fabricated Rb vapor cells illuminated with a low-power vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser allows for significant reductions of instrument size and power, while retaining the ability to provide an absolute reference. The present prototype has a total mass of 210 g (sensors and electronics), uses <1 W of power, and operates in both Mx and Mz mode, allowing high measurement speed and absolute accuracy. A sensitivity of 15 pT/√Hz at 1 Hz, or 0.1 nT rms, at a sampling time of 100 ms has been demonstrated in a laboratory environment (TRL 4).
The objective of the proposed work is to leverage our advances toward a low-resource absolute magnetometer within the PICASSO program and develop and demonstrate in a relevant environment a prototype vector instrument for resource-constrained solar system body exploration including ocean worlds and in particular the Europa lander. The development consists of: (a) testing key sensor components for the Europa radiation environment and incorporating mitigation steps in the sensor design; (b) implementing vector measurement capability; (c) designing and fabricating a low thermal resource magnetic field sensor; (d) implementing electronics in flight-equivalent packaging; (e) quantifying instrument performance characteristics; and (f) demonstrating the prototype in relevant thermal and vibration environments.
The result will be a TRL-6 qualified instrument with well-defined resource requirements and performance characteristics. The proposed effort will substantially improve instrument measurement capabilities for planetary science missions in support of the Science Mission Directorate’s Planetary Science Division, which is the ultimate goal of the Maturation of Instruments for Solar System Exploration (MatISSE) program."
"The Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11 consists of estimates of human population density (number of persons per square kilometer) based on counts consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020.Ã¯Â¿Â½A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, was used to assign population counts to 30 arc-second grid cells. The population density rasters were created by dividing the population count raster for a given target year by the land area raster. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second (~1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second count data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions to produce density rasters at these resolutions."
"A compact microgravity and hypogravity compatible vacuum device is proposed to provide medical suction and containment of extracted fluids.  The proposed aspirator will draw up to 40 L/min of air and produce a nominal vacuum of 500-mm Hg, which is comparable to commercially available medical aspirators.  The unit will also provide a means for separation and containment of up to 1000 mL of aspirated fluids.  Waste material separation will be accomplished by a reticulated foam trap that will utilize hydrophilic adsorbent materials to sequester liquids within the reticulated foam structure.  The aspirator assembly will also include a sub-micron filter to prevent aerosol from escaping to the spacecraft cabin.  During the Phase I research, an efficient trap will be designed and tested using a commercial off the shelf (COTS) vacuum pump.  Additional trap features will be investigated including collapsible walls to minimize storage space and chemical resistance to enable suction of corrosive and/or toxic materials.  Phase II research will focus on improving overall ESM and incorporating features such as a trap fill level indicator, an emergency shutoff in case of liquid breakthrough, and an alarm indicating a blocked airway, which will improve microgravity performance."

"Execution and monitoring of command plans are central for spacecraft
operations. Diverse execution engines and languages exist to define such
command plans. Language dependent development tools have been created
for such languages. However, there is not a reusable framework and code
base that can be used to create such automation tools even thought there
are many commonalties in the functionality and form of such tools. As a
consequence, existing automation tools cannot be easily adapted across
missions or languages. We proposed the development of an authoring and
debugging framework for the definition of spacecraft operation plans.
The framework provides a reusable code base that facilitates the
creation of authoring and debugging tools tailored to a particular
language and particular user type. Traditional text based authoring will
be complemented with graphical representations of plans that provide
friendly abstractions of a language's low level execution details.
Traditional in-line debugging techniques will be enhanced with
context-based visual debugging techniques suitable to understand the
rationale of why a plan or rule has been applied and the interactions
between different plans running in parallel.  The Phase I prototype will
illustrate the utility of the proposed framework by developing editors
and debuggers for PLEXIL and SCL."
"We have invented a new class of robotics, called `Pneubotics', that rival current manipulators in payload and reach at 1/10th the weight. Our technology leverages insights into lightweight materials and mass manufacturing to create robots that derive power, structure, and movement from pressurized air. As a result, drive trains, motors, bearings, shafts, sliding surfaces, and excess structural material are eliminated, leading the way for robots that exhibit extremely high strength to weight ratios, inherent human safe operation, and high degrees of freedom at comparatively low part count. 

This transformative new technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of automated material handling on missions beyond low earth orbit. The compliant nature of these robotic systems allows them to robustly grasp arbitrarily shaped objects and make them ideal for operating around sensitive equipment or cooperatively with humans. Similarly, due to their fluidic architecture they can be deflated and stowed for efficient transport.  The work described in this phase I SBIR proposal aims to develop the key technological components that will allow the production of Pneubotic systems, including novel pressure vessel based fabric actuator design, a pneumatic power architecture that exceeds electromagnetic efficiency, and dynamic models of inflated fabric structures. These components will enable the construction of a full prototype manipulation system in phase II."

"C-CAT, which has proven carbon-carbon fabrication capabilities, will investigate use of ACC-6 High Melt oxidation protective system on carbon-carbon for use on the Cryogenic and Non-Toxic Storable Propellant Space Engine nozzle and nozzle extensions.  

ACC-6 High Melt is a carbon-carbon coating application that embeds HfC,ZrB2 in the outer layers.  This material system has been tested in Arc Jet environment at over 3000 degrees F, for more than 24 minutes with little to no erosion.  ACC-6 High Melt has shown to be the best performing high temperature material system, and still retains the ease of manufacturing associated with carbon-carbon.

ACC-6 High Melt has been manufactured in small scale leading edge experiments, but has yet to be demonstrated in large components.  Manufacturability of large scale components remains as the main question to be answered for this material system.  For Phase I, C-CAT proposes to build subsections of a nozzle extension representing the attach flange and the exit diameter of approximately 40"" diameter. Success will be achieved by manufacturing the aforementioned subsection using ACC-6 High Melt with no voids or spalling of coating.  This successful demonstration will provide the path for scale-up to a full size prototype nozzle extension for Phase II."

"Among the numerous technological advances sought in order to facilitate human space travel, solutions and innovations are needed for techniques that supports the mass- and energy-efficient maintenance of closed air, water, and waste systems in spacecraft habitats that operate within microgravity. As missions are foreseen to be extended with limited earth resupply available there is need to develop durable and sustainable closed loop living systems. Waste water treatment and recovery system that is managed by ECLSS on board the ISS is one such system that has lifetime/durability limitations and would benefit from improvements to increase its lifetime efficiency. Therefore, in order to achieve NASA?s goals of extended manned deep space missions, Faraday Technology Inc. and Dr. Carlos Cabrera of the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) propose to develop a technique to eliminate many of the contaminants that commonly foul the waste water treatment system and produce a more durable closed loop process compatible with existing ECLSS mainframe to treat and recover water. In this program, UPR will develop enzyme based bio-reactor to efficiently convert urea to ammonia, while Faraday will scale and optimize ammonia electrolyzer incorporating custom-fabricated gas diffusion cathode and anode. This integrated system is anticipated to enable significant performance enhancement by reducing osmosis membrane fouling caused by contaminants from the waste stream and thereby increasing the efficiency and durability of the treatment process. This technology has the potential to be compatible with existing ECLSS systems and be an integral part of the closed loop living systems required for long term life support on NASA?s manned space missions."
"A key component to solving many engineering challenges of UAS integration into the National Airspace System is the ability to state the numbers of forecasted UAS by airframe and mission/operation type being performed within discrete airspaces. UAS growth is a function of locational based businesses and public use needs, in addition to increases in UAS uses and future aircraft types. Being able to forecast this growth requires time consuming and highly detailed configuration and model development, consensus between different organizations, and flexible tools tunable to changing perspectives. Availability of a common cloud based application integrating varying growth curves and linking geospatial aspects of UAS operations will greatly enhance and stabilize system level analysis of issues such as: radio spectrum usage, safety case analysis, economic forecasts, etc. Individuals and organizations would benefit in using a community centric tool with the ability to shared data and projections while still allowing individual researchers to set up paradigms for their own, unique forecasts.  The overall project objective is to design, develop, and study the feasibility and potential benefits of a UAS Demand Generator for Discrete Airspace Density (UAxpan) system which allows for common solutions in complex forecasts of growth and uses of numerous unmanned systems and mission/operational types. This will be accomplished by developing and testing a prototype system and performing the key functionality objectives using real industry, UAS, geographic, and NAS data."

"Ridgetop's role is to develop electronic prognostics for sensing power systems in support of NASA/Ames ADAPT testbed. The prognostic enabled power systems from Ridgetop are to be integrated into NASA's Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) and later used in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).   Prognostics will provide power supply ""state of health"", remaining useful life (RUL) and notify operators of impending failures so that load-shedding or orderly switch-overs can be supported.

Using the ADAPT at NASA/Ames Research Center, Ridgetop will design, implement and validate a prototype prognostic sensor that employs both analog circuits and digital logic in a microcontroller unit (MCU) or microproprocessor controller (MPC) to ""prognostics-enable"" a high efficiency switching power converter.
The ADAPT is a testbed, developed to explore health-management systems in manned spaceflight with three main goals: 1) to assess performance of diagnostic tools and algorithms against a standardized testbed and repeatable failure scenarios, 2) to develop prognostic models (performance degradation, remaining life estimation) for spacecraft subsystems, and 3) prototype Advanced Caution and Warning System (ACAWS) algorithms and user interfaces.  

By developing effective and practical prognostics for a power supply, Ridgetop's role will be to extend the capabilities of the ADAPT testbed."

"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the development of an asymmetric supercapacitor that will have improved energy density and cycle life. Supercapacitors that utilize an aqueous electrolyte are limited to a maximum voltage of 1 volt due to the decomposition of water. Methods used to increase voltage include use of an organic electrolyte, which introduces additional complexity, cost and undesirable environmental concerns, or to use an asymmetric or hybrid configuration, with two different electrode materials. Supercapacitors that utilize MnO2 and carbon as the electrodes have been developed. However, due to changes in the MnO2 while cycling the capacitor to 2 volts, the MnO2 will change over time and lose its ability to cycle. One method around this problem, reported in the literature, is to charge the capacitor to 1.5 volts, resulting in reduced power and energy storage. In this Phase I program Giner, Inc. will demonstrate a novel solution to this problem by modifying the MnO2 positive electrode through the use of magnetic microparticles dispersed throughout the electrode structure. Using a Giner, Inc. novel high-energy density carbon as the negative electrode, complete, button-cell capacitors will be assembled and tested."

"FOR EXPERT USE ONLY.  This dataset contains estimates of ocean bottom pressure derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission measurements, produced by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ).  The data are in spherical harmonics averaged over approximately a month.  The primary objective of the GRACE mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field variations.  This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 500 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 200 km apart, using a microwave ranging system.  In addition to these range change, the non-gravitional forces are measured on each satellite using a high accuracy electrostatic, room-temperature accelerometer.  The satellite orientation and position (and timing) are precisely measured using twin star cameras and a GPS receiver, respectively.  Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field affect the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently.  These differences are manifested as changes in the distance between the spacecraft, as they orbit the Earth.  This change in distance is reflected in the time-of-flight of microwave signals transmitted and received nearly simultaneously between the two spacecraft.  The change in this time of fight is continuously measured by tracking the phase of the microwave carrier signals.  The so called dual-one-way range change measurements can be reconstructed from these phase measurements.  This range change (or its numerically derived derivatives), along with other mission and ancillary data, is subsequently analyzed to extract the parameters of an Earth gravity field model."
"Flight-critical systems rely on an ever increasing amount of software&#151;the Boe- ing 777 contains over 2 million lines of code. Most of this code is written in the C programming language. We need a scalable static formal program verification tool that is able to prove the functional correctness of flight-critical software, limiting any failure of flight critical software to hardware faults.
This project seeks to leverage the matching logic verification framework. Matching logic is generic in an operational semantic of a given programming language, so we also seek to give a semantics of a subset of C, called CIL, which is guaranteed to be deterministic. While we already have a semantics for the entirety of C, CIL is more representative of flight-critical software, and the simpler, deterministic semantics will result in a more efficient, and thus more scalable, static program verification tool. We are also building a new unification- based rewrite engine that will result in a more powerful version of the Matching Logic Framework.  In order to make the tool more commercially feasible, we will develop new techniques in pattern inference, so that loop invariants and some pre/post conditions can be determined automatically.  We will perform a thorough evaluation of our tool on a large-scale piece of software with similar characteristics to a flight system."

"NASA's  Vision for Space Exploration advocates a return to the moon and involves a plan of using the moon as a base of for missions to other planets.  Early return missions to the moon will involve lunar exploration with robotic spacecrafts with instrumental payloads for scientific measurements of lunar surface features such as rocks, soil, and minerals.  These instrument payloads will be helpful in identifying lunar resources that can be used in establishing extended human presence. Raman spectroscopy has been actively investigated as a lunar as well as a Mars surface robotic investigative tool for minerals. Current Raman instruments for space exploration utilize a single excitation wavelength, with a laser in the near-infrared (IR) to minimize fluorescence background.  However, even with the near-IR Raman excitation, background emissions such as fluorescence, F-center luminescence, and blackbody emission can still be a problem.  The goal of this project is to employ a dual excitation (visible and near-IR lasers) Raman instrument to minimize background emission.  To achieve this goal, a dual excitation wavelength fiber optically coupled Raman probe head and a compact wide spectral range echelle spectrograph will be developed."

"We propose to develop a Multi-Element Lean Direct Injection, ME-LDI, Combustion concept with the following innovative features:
1.	Independent, mini burning zones created by containing the flame in a cylinder downstream of each fuel injector/swirler element in a multiple fuel injector array, see figure 1.  The independent burning zones will enable fuel staging the fuel injectors (turning off fuel to selected fuel injectors) to cover the operating cycle, such that at each point of the operating cycle the combustor will have high combustion efficiency (>99%) and low NOx emissions. At high power conditions the combustion efficiency should be greater than 99.9%.
2.	A low flow number, ""Butterfly"" fuel injector will be incorporated into ME-LDI that is low cost and simple to manufacture but a highly effective atomizer.  The term ""Butterfly"" derives from the butterfly shape of the spray.  The shape of the spray is formed by two diametrically opposed slots cut through a closed end fuel tube, see figure 2.  The fuel flow through each slot forms a fan spray.  The slot width can be varied to control drop-sizes within the spray."

"The overall goal of the proposed phase II SBIR program is to develop a compact, high SNR TDI APD array for future NASA earth observing missions. The enabling TDI APD technology is based on ultra-high sensitivity AlInAs/GaInAs APDs operable in the 1240 to 1640-nm spectra band integrated with Si CCDs that will enable for the first time, true TDI and CCD-like detector operation at these wavelengths. The performance of this TDI APD array will meet or exceed current performance requirements for radiometric sensors. The TDI APD array sensor will be designed to operate at 300K resulting in a significant weight, size and power reduction. At the conclusion of the program, we will deliver to NASA for evaluation and for mission insertion, fully packaged end-to-end tested TDI APD arrays with SNR in the range of 570-1066 within the 1240-nm and 1640-nm spectral band."

"The SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) project is an oceanographic process study and associated field program that aim to elucidate key mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the oceans. The project involves two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes.  SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales.  The SPURS-1 campaign involved a series of 5 cruises during 2012 - 2013 seeking to characterize the salinity structure and balance in a high salinity, high evaporation, and low rainfall region of the subtropical North Atlantic. It aims to resolve processes responsible for maintaining the subtropical surface salinity maximum in this region and within a 900 x 800-mile square study area centered at 25N, 38W.  Two PICO moorings (PICO-1000, PICO-3000) were deployed on the Knorr cruise in September 2012 in the northern and eastern SPURS-1 domain quadrants at N24.74, W37.95 and N24.51, W37.81 respectively. The moorings contained a surface meteorological package and a ""prawler"", a CTD that crawls up and down the mooring line from the near-surface down to about 500m, yielding time series of salinity and temperature profile data at fixed locations. The moorings were recovered on the Endeavor-2 cruise.  PICO mooring netCDF files contain georeferenced CTD profile data including salinity, temperature, potential temperature, pressure, depth, meteorological variables, GPS-Lat/Lon, and profile ID."
"This dataset provides mole fractions of atmospheric trace gases measured by the Programmable Flask Package (PFP) Whole Air Sampler during airborne campaigns conducted by NASA's Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission. The PFP whole air sampler provides a means of automated or manual filling of glass flasks. The sampler is designed to remove excess water vapor from the sampled air and compress it without contamination into ~1-liter volumes. These flasks are analyzed at the NOAA's Global Monitoring Division laboratory for trace gases and at the INSTAR's Staple Isotope Lab laboratory for isotopes of methane. Analysis of standardized PFP samples can measure more than 60 trace gases including N2O, SF6, H2, CS2, OCS, CO2, CH4, CO, CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, Solvents, Methyl Halides, Hydrocarbons and Perfluorocarbons. The ATom mission deployed an extensive gas and aerosol payload on the NASA DC-8 aircraft for systematic, global-scale sampling of the atmosphere, profiling continuously from 0.2 to 12 km altitude. Flights occurred in each of 4 seasons from 2016 to 2018."

"An active and tunable metamaterial phased array transducer for guided wave mode selection with high intensity per driving channel and with dramatically lower modal noise when compared to the state of the art. The innovation exploits aspect of phased array based guided wave mode selection theory, whose practical significance seems to be ignored in the state of the art. These aspects include a) low modal noise when the phased array has small inter-element distance and a large number of elements and; b) phased delays necessary for driving the phased array elements have an apparent periodicity and anti-symmetry. As a consequence of exploiting the first factors the proposed phased array transducer can be classified as an active tuneable metamaterial. The second factor is mentioned above is exploited to reduce the number of driving channels by using switching matrices to interface between the driving channels and the metamaterial transducer. Fidelity of inspection and cost-effectiveness are the primary features of the innovation."

"In the proposed Phase II program, Busek Co. will demonstrate an innovative methodology for clustering Hall thrusters into a high performance, very high power propulsion system.  To fulfill the full range of Hall thruster power requirements (100 kW ? 1 MW) envisioned by NASA for orbit insertion, planetary transfers and manned exploration, rather than developing a >500kW system with one or two large thrusters there are clear advantages to reach the very high power by clustering multiple thrusters of lower power.  In the Phase I program, Busek demonstrated a shared magnetics clustering concept that combined the benefits of simple clustering with additional advantages such as the mass savings and power loss reduction of a shared magnetic structure.  In Phase II, Busek will demonstrate an alternative shared magnetics concept of clustering and design, fabricate and test a sub-scale nested thruster.  The nested thruster consists of two concentric discharge cavities that share a portion of the magnetic structure.  Busek will also continue to investigate the shared magnetics concept of the Phase I program and merge the nested concept into the shared magnetics cluster architecture.

Busek is uniquely positioned to implement the proposed program having expertise in both the clustering of Hall thrusters and shared magnetics thruster development."
"NASA is investigating a Mars Sample Return Mission, consisting of at least three separate missions: 1) Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher, MAX-C (sample acquisition and caching), 2) A fetch rover and the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), 3) Earth Return Vehicle (ERV). 
The primary goal of the MAX-C mission is to acquire ~20 cores, 1cm diameter by 5cm long, and place them in a cache for return back to Earth. Before deciding which cores to return, scientists would also need to analyze rocks in-situ. The tasks required for the MAX-C mission therefore would include: 

1.	Acquisition of 1cm x 5 cm core for earth return
2.	Acquisition of a core for in-situ analysis
3.	Acquisition of rock powder for in situ analysis
4.	Brushing of rocks for in situ analysis (as done on MER)
5.	Abrading of rocks for in situ analysis (as done on MER)

In this proposal we are advocating an approach used every day in terrestrial applications; that is having a single appliance (drill) with many attachments (various bit types for coring, caching, abrading, brushing and powder acquisition) for different applications. This approach offers mass, cost and volume savings and thus will be particularly attractive to the MAX-C mission."
"This data set contains electron parameters in the PLS energy range (10-5950 eV) at Uranus during the Voyager 2 encounter. Parameters are calculated in several ways. Total moment density and temperature are given. Each electron spectrum is also fit with a thermal component and 1-3 hot components depending on how many Maxwellians are needed to fit the entire distribution. The moment density and temperature of the hot component is calculated after the thermal component is subtracted from the spectrum. The CHI-Square value for each fit is given. The spacecraft charge is not calculated consistently, and may result in factor of 2-3 errors in the thermal electron density. Data is unreliable inside 5 RU and in the occultation regions. At Uranus measurements were taken using both a long and a short integration time. Each 48 SEC measurement frame contained either an E1-Short and an E2-Long measurement or an E2-Short and an EI-Long. To reduce systematic errors, complete electron spectra were obtained only by combining two long or two short spectra. The instrument threshold is at a density of about 0.001 CM-3 yield data close to this value should be treated with caution. Flags in the data indicate whether the full analysis could be performed and if the data was contaminated by LECP stepping. A complete description of this data set is in Sittler et al. (1987)."
"In the Phase I program we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Pulsed ElectroGasdynamic (PEG) thruster for attitude control and orbital maneuvering. In this thruster, propellant gas is introduced into the thrust nozzle through a fast acting gas valve where a short, high voltage pulse is applied to break down and heat the propellant gas. The heated gas expands in the nozzle generating a high impulse (~mN-s per pulse) at a high specific thrust (120 £gN-s/joule). The specific impulse (Isp) will be in the range of 500~1500 sec. This process can be repeated at a frequency to meet the spacecraft thrust requirements. The thrust generating mechanism of the proposed thruster is gasdynamic expansion, not magnetohydrodynamic interaction. The proposed thruster is different from the conventional pulsed electrothermal thruster in that the joule heating of the propellant takes place as the propellant gas expands through the divergent nozzle, thereby eliminating the heat and momentum losses at the nozzle throat. Our Phase II objectives are: (i) develop an engineering model; and (ii) develop a proto-flight model of the proposed thruster system."

"The ERBE-like Footprint TOA Fluxes (ES-8) product contains 24 hours of instantaneous Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for a single scanner instrument, Flight Model 3 (FM3) on the Aqua spacecraft. The ES-8 contains filtered radiances recorded every 0.01-second for the total (TOT), shortwave (SW), and window (WN) channels and the unfiltered SW, longwave (LW), and WN radiances. The SW and LW radiances at spacecraft altitude are converted to Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA) fluxes with a scene identification algorithm and Angular Distribution Models (ADMs) which are ""like"" those used for the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). The TOA fluxes, scene identification, and angular geometry are included on the ES-8.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002.

"The integrated NASA/DoD electric propulsion objectives are for a
specific mass less than 3 kg/kW while demonstrating a throttlable
thrust-to-power ratio of 100:1 at a specific impulse of 1,000 sec down
to 40:1 at 4,000 sec with an operational lifetime exceeding 20,000
hours.  Modern Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) are a proven technology with
flight heritage, established manufacturing readiness and testing
channels that nearly meet the desired specifications (as shown in Figure
1).  However, the major limitation is that HETs fail to achieve all four
of objectives simultaneously. This Phase I feasibility study is focused
on a proof-of-concept experiment to alleviate the HET dual-mode
operational envelope limitation for both high thrust-to-power and high
specific impulse.   Starfire Industries believes that a &quot;low
hanging fruit&quot; modification to HETs exists, and such an improvement
would be evolutionary to enable multi-mission EP systems for NASA's
Science Mission Directorate and DoD platforms.  Towards this end,
Starfire has partnered with Aerojet Corporation to rapidly demonstrate
feasibility in Phase I through experimental modification to an existing
HET system.  If results are confirmed, a Phase II design can be driven
to yield immediate upgrades for flight-qualified HET systems for
near-term payback."

"The proposed effort aims to develop technologies for high-precision pointing in small satellites to enable detection of Earth-sized exoplanets transiting nearby, Sun-like stars. This overall goal of precision pointing is broken down into two distinct research objectives. The first is to develop staged control algorithms with narrowband disturbance rejection to combine the benefits of systematic staged control synthesis with high attenuation of tonal disturbances arising from sources such as reaction wheels. While both topics have been developed independently, they have not been combined in a single control system. The second research objective is to develop estimation techniques to develop improved estimation techniques for staged control that estimates high-frequency disturbances with the use of low-cost sensors.

These research objectives will be carried out by first developing a simulation, based on hardware component testing. The developed algorithms can be tested and tuned rapidly in this simulation. In addition, trade studies will be performed with this simulation to inform the final design of the satellite. To demonstrate the algorithms and validate the simulation results, hardware-in-the-loop testbeds will be fabricated. To streamline this process, embeddable code will be generated directly from the simulation. The hardware tests will culminate in a full three-degree-of-freedom test of the staged control system.

This proposed effort directly supports the NASA space technology goal to create ""innovative new space technologies for our nation's science, exploration, and economic future."" High-precision pointing in small satellites is also one of NASA's goals for Game Changing Technology. In addition, the mission of finding Earth-like planets is aligned one of NASA's goals in the 2006-2016 Strategic Plan."
"The Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Basic Demographic Characteristics, Revision 11 consists of estimates of human population by age and sex as counts (number of persons per pixel) and densities (number of persons per square kilometer), consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the year 2010. To estimate the male and female populations by age in 2010, the proportions of males and females in each 5-year age group from ages 0-4 to ages 85+ for the given census year were calculated. These proportions were then applied to the 2010 estimates of the total population to obtain 2010 estimates of male and female populations by age. In some cases, the spatial resolution of the age and sex proportions was coarser than the resolution of the total population estimates to which they were applied. The population density rasters were created by dividing the population count rasters by the land area raster. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second (~1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions."

"Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) is a 10-channel spectro-radiometer (317 – 780 nm) onboard NOAA’s DSCOVR spacecraft located at the Earth-Sun Lagrange-1 (L-1) point, giving EPIC a unique angular perspective that is used in science applications to measure ozone, aerosols, cloud reflectivity, cloud height, vegetation properties, and UV radiation estimates at Earth's surface. EPIC provides 10 narrow-band spectral images of the entire sunlit face of the Earth using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope. EPIC collects radiance data of the Earth and other sources through the Camera/Telescope Assembly. EPIC has a field of view (FOV) of 0.62 degrees, sufficient to image the entire Earth. Because of DSCOVR's tilted (Lissajous) orbit about the L‐1 point, the apparent angular size of the Earth varies from 0.45 to 0.53 degrees within its 6-month orbital period. Depending on the season, a complete set of per-band images is taken every 60 to 100 minutes.Accompanying instrument metadata and a series of calibrations and corrections are applied to properly convert the images to Level 1A format. The major corrections are for flat‐fielding and stray light. Flat-fielding is based on measurements with a uniform light source to measure the differences in sensitivity for each of the 4 million pixels. The resulting correction map is applied to the measured counts from the CCD. Stray light was measured in the laboratory using a series of small diameter light sources entering the telescope and imaged on the CCD. A similar set of measurements has been performed on orbit using the moon. The illumination of pixels outside the main diameter of the light source was measured to produce a detailed matrix map of the entire stray light function, and the resulting stray light correction is applied to every image. Other corrections are also applied based on laboratory measurements. For wavelengths longer than 550 nm there are back to front interference effects in the partially transparent CCD (etaloning) that must also be removed from the measured radiances.The Level 1A products contain calibrated EPIC images with ancillary metadata and geolocation information. These data products are in HDF5 format."

"<p>All approaches to starlight suppression are subject to spectral bandpass limitations.

"TIROS-2 Medium-Resolution Scanning Radiometer Level 1 Final Meteorological Radiation Data (FMRT) product contains radiances expressed in five infrared/visible wavelength regions, expressed in either equivalent blackbody temperature (IR channels 1 and 2) or effective radiant emmitance (visible channels 3 and 5). The data will trace an elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic pattern on the ground due to the rotating of the instrument about the satellite spin axis. There is one orbit per file. The data were originally written on IBM 7094 machines, and these have been recovered from magnetic tapes, referred to as the Final Meteorological Radiation Tapes (FMRT). The data are archived in their original IBM 36-bit word proprietary format, also referred to as a binary TAP file.

The TIROS-2 satellite was successfully launched on November 23, 1960. The Medium-Resolution Scanning Radiometer experiment successfully returned data for about five months, becoming the first radiometer to make meteorlogical measurements from space. Three follow-on instruments were flown on TIROS-3, -4 and -7. Initially, all channels performed normally. However, channels 1 and 4 gradually deteriorated and by January 1961 were useless. The signal to noise ratio of channels 3 and 5 was extremely low, and the output was highly questionable. The instrument is a five channel radiometer with a 55 km footprint at nadir with the following characteristics:

Channel 1: 6.0 to 6.5 microns - water vapor absorption
Channel 2: 8.0 to 12.0 microns - atmospheric window
Channel 3: 0.2 to 6.0 microns - reflected solar radiation
Channel 4: 8.0 to 30 microns - terrestial radiation
Channel 5: 0.55 to 0.75 microns - response to the TV system

The Principal Investigator for these data was Joseph D. Barksdale from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This product was previously available from the NSSDC with the identifier ESAD-00113 (old ID 60-016A-02A)."
"The West Africa Coastal Vulnerability Mapping: Deforestation, 2000-2012, layer was created from the Global Forest Change data set which represents global tree cover extent, loss, and gain mapped for the period from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30m, with loss allocated annually. The Global Forest Change data set defines trees as all vegetation taller than 5m in height. Forest loss (deforestation) is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state. The data on forest loss were aggregated to a one kilometer resolution and subsetted to 200 kilometers from the coast to produce this data set. Raster values represent the percentage of the grid cell area that experienced forest cover loss from 2000 to 2012."

"The AIRMISR_ROGERS_LAKE_2001 data were acquired during a flight over Roger's Lake, California on June 6, 2001. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA.Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes.The 9 camera viewing angles are:0 degrees or nadir26.1 degrees, fore and aft45.6 degrees, fore and aft60.0 degrees, fore and aft70.5 degrees, fore and aftFor each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are:443 nanometers, blue555 nanometers, green670 nanometers, red865 nanometers, near-infraredTwo types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2)."
"The data set consists of weekly gridded Level-3 products of Aquarius L-band radiometer brightness temperature (TB) observations and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) retrievals from the Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC-D) mission, developed collaboratively between the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Argentina's space agency, Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE)."
"Substantial progress has been made by NASA in integrating flight avionics and ISHM with well-defined caution and warning system, however, the scope of ACAW alerting and response systems is still limited to a single failure response mapping. While the approach of single Caution And Warning (CW) message mapped to a single response procedure may be sufficient for simple cases, for a well-connected system with inter-dependencies among the components a single component failure will likely negatively impact other components functions downstream that are dependent on the failed component. This may lead to the generation of multiple CW messages and hence the potential invocation of multiple conflicting malfunction and response and recovery procedures. QSI is proposing, with significant feedback from the NASA COR and other NASA stakeholders, on a more proactive approach that improves the CW message generation itself and produces a more appropriate, prioritized and actionable set of CW messages through the identification of the root cause failures, impact or consequence analysis of those failures and the associated risk assessment all of which are critical to the choice for the appropriate response/recovery procedure(s). The proposed solution will provide real-time capability to assess the health and its impact on the capability of a spacecraft, and utilize it to identify suitable recovery options to ensure crew safety and mission success. It will enable smarter crew displays that tie together System Health, Advanced Caution Advisory and Warning System (ACAWS) messages and recommended recovery procedures, thereby improving the decision-making ability of the crew for deep space missions."
"This data set reports the ages and growth rates of trees determined by radiocarbon dating (14C) in three Amazonia forests. Tree samples were collected from permanent research plots at ZF2 km 34, Manaus, Amazonas, the Catuaba Experimental Farm, Acre, and the km 83 tower site (logged forest site) in the Tapajos National Forest, Para, between 2001-2003.Samples from 97 individual trees were either tree cores (Manaus and Acre) or a combination of tree cores and slabs cut from stems as part of the logging in the Tapajos National Forest (Para). Radiocarbon dating(14C)was used to determine the age and the mean diameter growth increment of samples from individual trees in various diameter size classes.  These measurements can be used to verify and extend short-term diameter increment measurements done with dendrometers and to constrain models of tree demography.There is one comma-separated ASCII  data file with this data set."
"The development of new, robust, lightweight systems for CO2 removal during EVA is a crucial need for NASA.  With current activity focused on the development of Lunar outposts, mission times will need to be extended without increasing the size and weight of the portable life support system (PLSS).  While much of the recent work on the development of new CO2 control strategies has centered on sorbents that can be regenerated during the mission, these system add ""on back"" hardware, increasing weight and complexity, and reducing reliability.  

A simpler approach is to use a membrane system to separate CO2 and H2O from the O2 environment.  Unfortunately, separating gas phase molecules with the needed selectivity is difficult with standard membrane materials.  However, converting CO2 and H2O to compounds with much different properties, could allow the needed separation to be achieved.  Therefore in this Phase I project, Reaction Systems will develop a liquid membrane that will have high permeance and selectivity for CO2 and H2O compared to O2, resulting in a TRL = 4.  In Phase II we will advance the TRL to 6 by designing and constructing a full scale prototype, which will be delivered it to NASA."

"<p style=""margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"">In response to NASA&rsquo;s topic T12.02 of &ldquo;Extensible Modeling of Metallurgical Additive Manufacturing Processes&rdquo;, Sentient proposes to incorporate its <strong>DigitalClone</strong> technique to develop a multiscale and multiphysics computational modeling suite to predict comprehensive outcomes from AM building processes, including geometrical accuracy, and resulting microstructure and defects. <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the proposed framework for the multiscale modeling suite.

"Future human space exploration missions will require advanced life support technology that can operate across a wide range of applications and environments.  Thermal control systems for space suits and spacecraft will need to meet critical requirements for water conservation and adaptability to highly variable thermal environments.  To achieve these goals, we propose an International Space Station (ISS) demonstration program for an innovative Space Evaporator Absorber Radiator (SEAR) technology.  A SEAR system comprises a lithium chloride absorber radiator (LCAR) for heat rejection coupled with a space water membrane evaporator (SWME) for heat acquisition.  SEAR systems provide heat pumping to minimize radiator size, thermal storage to accommodate variable environmental conditions, and water absorption to minimize use of expendables.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by building and testing an LCAR with flight-like internal structures and designing an ISS demonstration experiment.  In Phase II we will design and build a SEAR test module according to ISS flight requirements and demonstrate its operation in ground tests that simulate flight test conditions."

"This research proposes to enhance solar cell efficiency, radiation resistance and affordability. The Quantum Dot Spectrum Converter (QDSC) disperses quantum dots into the transparent silicone layer that normally functions as coverglass adhesive. The Quantum Dots (QD) act as a fluorescent spectrum converter for solar cells, to allow the use of the 20-50% of the solar spectrum unavailable to today's highest efficiency solar cells. By selecting QD's of particular compositions and sizes, we customize absorption and emission spectra to down-convert UV photons, including multiple exciton generation, and up-convert IR photons in a multiple photon process. This approach overcomes the fundamental 'red-loss' and 'blue-loss' limitations, allowing more efficiency from conventional single- and multi-bandgap photovoltaic devices. We also explore the use of a QDSC in a non-tracking fluorescent concentrator for enhancing flux and shielding for solar cells and in thermophotovoltaic systems as a means of enhancing efficiency while eliminating selective emitters. These approaches address the topic need for significantly improved efficiency and radiation hardening for deep space missions ? the QDSC can significantly enhance conversion efficiency of qualified, high-efficiency cells, while its implementation in a luminescent or thermophotovoltaic concentrator allows solar cells to be shielded from adverse radiation and thermal environments."
"CRG has recently developed a new class of shape memory polymers (SMP) that are electrically activated, as opposed to the more mature thermally activated SMPs. Electrically activated shape memory polymers (EASMP) open a new design space of unexplored functionality beyond what has been considered for thermally activated materials. This project will combine the advantages of EASMP with the design of state-of-the-art gearbox isolators and interior panels to provide the ability to tune these components for specific operational frequencies. With the use of EASMP integrated components, by semi-actively altering the interior panels or gearbox isolators' frequency response, it will be possible to better target and control particularly irritating tones related to the aircraft's flight mode. CRG proposes to advance EASMP maturity which is applicable across many other application areas and has the benefit of alternative stimuli boasting ultra-low power requirements and more potential for faster switching times. This material will be refined and further developed to meet the operational performance requirements for the rotorcraft isolator application."
"This is a proposal to develop an electronic, focusing schlieren system for flight research based on electronic cameras and spatial light modulators as dynamic programmable masks. Schlieren methods are widely used to visualize turbulence and shock phenomena. Focusing schlieren systems are ideal for applications requiring a large field of view, and are the preferred methods for outdoor schlieren systems. One schlieren technique for large field studies is the use of focusing schlieren with background grids. Recently, schlieren systems that use the sun as a background source have been developed for studying shock waves for aircraft in flight. The application of both schlieren techniques is restricted by the capabilities of fixed schlieren cut-off masks. Liquid crystal spatial light modulators afford greater flexibility, as the correct cut-off mask can be programmed and updated electronically. Since the spatial light modulators can be updated at video rates or faster, there is also the possibility of using the SLMs to correct for changes in the background. In addition, we will incorporate state of the art electronic cameras."

NASA  s Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.

"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."

"Silicon Carbide based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) offer the potential to fundamentally change the design and manufacture of aeronautical and space propulsion systems to significantly increase performance and fuel efficiency over current metal-based designs. Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and our team members at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) are developing, designing and fabricating enhanced SiC-based matrices capable of long term operation at 2750oF to 3000oF in the combustion environment. Our approach is successfully building upon PSI's and UCSB's previous work in incorporating refractory and rare earth species into the SiC matrix to increase the CMC use temperatures and life-time capabilities by improving the protective oxide passivation layer that forms during use. As part of this work we are creating physics based-materials and process models that qualitatively define methods of improving matrix properties and the interaction of the fibers, interphases and matrix with each other.

In the Phase I program the PSI team developed and experimentally demonstrated CMC's capable of withstanding 100's of hours of oxidation at 2700oF with no degradation. We have focused predicting the effect of phase distribution, grain size, chemical composition, matrix density, and surface flaws on the oxidation behavior of the CMC matrix. During the Phase II program we will iteratively improve the CMC performance by optimizing the composition and characteristics of the additives based on oxidation and mechanical test results and burner rig exposure testing."

State-of-the-art rechargeable Li-ion batteries are incapable of fulfilling these stringent requirements.  We propose to develop high energy and power density nanocomposite cathodes that will lead to thermally stable, high energy and power density Li-ion batteries.  Working in collaboration with a leading developer of Li-ion polymer batteries, in Phase I, we will demonstrate that it is possible to produce a stable and high power density nanostructured cathode, along with good energy density.  As part of Phase I work, the electrochemical properties of these nanostructured cathodes will be evaluated in Li and Li-ion test cells with a liquid electrolyte.  In Phase II, prototype batteries will be fabricated and tested for performance, along with the optimization and scaling of the nanocomposite synthesis process."

"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."
"DISCOVER-AQ_P3B_insitu_Aerosol_Data_MD are NASA P-3B aircraft in-situ measurements of aerosol properties collected onboard the P-3B aircraft during the Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality project (DISCOVER-AQ) field campaign. This product is a result of NASA Earth-Venture funded mission DISCOVER-AQ. Data was collected for this product by the NASA Langley Aerosol Research Group (LARGE) during the first deployment of DISCOVER-AQ in Baltimore-Washington (2011). Instruments include Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS), Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), Particle-Into-Liquid Sampler (PILS), Nephelometers, Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP), Optical Particle Counter (OPC), and Ultra-High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer (UHSAS). Data collection is complete.
Monitoring air quality from space has made substantial progress, however, there are still many challenges faced today. One of those challenges that regulators face is monitoring the spatial distribution of pollutants as air quality monitoring networks are costly and have considerable gaps in their spatial coverage. Observations of near-surface pollution from satellites would provide an unprecedented view of the spatial distribution of pollution and could potentially provide a robust air quality observation system. NASA’s DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) was a multi-year field campaign aimed at improving our understanding of the role that remote sensing, including satellite-based remote sensing, could play in air quality monitoring systems. To achieve its science goals, DISCOVER-AQ employed two NASA aircraft, the P3-B and King Air, with the P-3B completing in-situ profiling of the atmosphere (aerosol properties, meteorological variables, and trace gas species). The King Air conducted both passive and active remote sensing of the atmospheric column extending below the aircraft to the surface. Data from an existing network of surface air quality monitors, AERONET sun photometers, Pandora UV/vis spectrometers and model simulations were also collected. Further, DISCOVER-AQ employed many surface monitoring sites, with measurements being made on the ground, in conjunction with the aircraft. Four campaigns collecting observations over different regions of the United States that are in violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). These campaigns included Baltimore-Washington (July 2011), San Joaquin Valley, California (January-February 2013), Houston, TX (September 2013), and Denver-Front Range region of Colorado (July-August 2014). The data collected during DISCOVER-AQ will improve the ability to monitor pollution from satellites and therefore allow scientists to make improved air quality forecasts."
"Aquarius Level 3 sea surface spiciness standard mapped image data contains gridded 1 degree spatial resolution spice data averaged over daily, 7 day, monthly, and seasonal time
scales. This particular data set is the Daily, Ascending sea surface spiciness product for version 5.0 of the Aquarius data set. Only retrieved values for Ascending passes have been used to create this product. The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit.  Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath."

"NASA is responsible for breakthrough research to assure that adding UAS to the US Airspace is safe to both manned and unmanned aircraft.  The FAA has made new rules that restrict small consumer and commercial UAS from operating beyond line of sight and over 500 feet in altitude but present day UAS controllers do not enforce these rules in hardware, and manual pilots cannot assure compliance with present day small UAS controls.  Furthermore, while many UAS have GPS awareness, they have virtually no awareness of potential collision events.
We propose to develop and demonstrate a collision safe and FAA rules enforcing UAS controller technology and make it available widely for consumer UAS licensing for low cost. 
Small outdoor UAVs for surveillance, small payload transport, and other applications are readily available in the commercial market and are remaking the lower altitude airspace.  These units navigate through direct teleoperation within line of sight of the operator and controller.  Some units also include GPS navigation so that they can accurately station-keep or move to a predetermined location and altitude.  The missing technology for this kind of autonomous operation is obstacle detection and avoidance integrated with controls in a low SWaP-C form factor."

It includes images from the Dawn Ceres  eXtended Mission 1 Orbit 3 (XMO3, aka Ceres Extended GRaND - CXG) phase  on 2017-02-19 and the Ceres eXtended Mission Orbit 4 (XMO4, aka Ceres    Extended Opposition - CXO) phase on 2017-04-29. In addition, there are   images from eXtended Mission 2 (XM2), orbits XMO6 (C2I - intermediate),  and XMO7 (C2E - elliptical) as well as some checkout and end-of-mission  star calibration images. FC1 is one of two identical units flying        on the Dawn spacecraft. It was designated as the backup system to be     used only in the event of a failure of the primary system, FC2. Prior to the Ceres extended mission, FC1 had only been used for in-flight         calibration and to periodically exercise its various mechanisms (door,   filter wheel, etc.).

"The NASA Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) Night Version 1 product (VNP21A1N) is compiled daily from nighttime Level 2 Gridded (L2G) intermediate products.  

The L2G process maps the daily (VNP21) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP21.001) swath granules onto a sinusoidal MODIS grid and stores all observations overlapping a gridded cell for a given night. The VNP21A1 algorithm sorts through all these observations for each cell and estimates the final LST value as an average from all cloud-free observations that have good LST accuracies. The nighttime average is weighted by the observation coverage for that cell. Only observations having observation coverage more than a certain threshold (15%) are considered for this averaging. The 1 kilometer dataset is derived through resampling the native 750 meter VIIRS resolution in the input product.

The VNP21A1N product is developed synergistically with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST&E Version 6 product (MOD21A1N) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1N.006) using the same input atmospheric products and algorithmic approach. The overall objective for NASA VIIRS products is to ensure the algorithms and products are compatible with the MODIS Terra and Aqua algorithms to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/428/VNP21_ATBD_V1.pdf). VIIRS LST&E products are available 2 months after acquisition due to latency of data inputs.

The VNP21A1N product contains seven Science Datasets (SDS): LST, quality control, emissivity for bands M14, M15, and M16, view zenith angle, and time of observation. A low-resolution browse image for LST is also available for each VNP21A1N granule."

"The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS Only Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

"The Coastal Zone Color Scanner Experiment (CZCS) was the first instrument devoted to the measurement of ocean color and flown on a spacecraft. Although other instruments flown on other spacecraft had sensed ocean color, their spectral bands, spatial resolution and dynamic range were optimized for land or meteorological use and had limited sensitivity in this area, whereas in CZCS, every parameter was optimized for use over water to the exclusion of any other type of sensing. CZCS had six spectral bands, four of which were used primarily for ocean color. These were of a 20 nanometer bandwidth centered at 443, 520, 550, and 670 nm. Band 5 had a 100 nm bandwidth centered at 750 nm and a dynamic range more suited to land. Band 6 operated in the 10.5 to 12.5 micrometer region and sensed emitted thermal radiance for derivation of equivalent black body temperature. (This thermal band failed within the first year of the mission, and so was not used in the global processing effort.) Bands 1-4 were preset to view water only and saturated when the IFOV was over most types of land surfaces, or clouds."
"ERBE_S10_WFOV_NF_NAT_1 is the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) S-10 Wide Field of View (WFOV) Numerical Filter (NF) Earth Flux and Albedo data product. Data collection for this product is complete. It is available in the Native (NAT) Format.

ERBE was a multi-satellite system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget. The ERBE instruments flew on a mid-inclination National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10). Each satellite carried both a scanner and a non-scanner instrument package. The non-scanner instrument package contained four Earth-viewing channels and a solar monitor. The Earth-viewing channels had two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth, and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter. The former was called WFOV and the latter the medium field-of-view (MFOV) channels. The solar monitor was a direct descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor detector. Due to the concern for spectral flatness and high accuracy, all five of the channels were active cavity radiometers. The MFOV (medium-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10 contained inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and long-wave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month. This data set was produced for each of the satellites (ERBS and NOAA-9) and the combination of satellites, which were operational during the data month. The values for this data set were derived using the shape factor technique (Smith et al. 1986). As described in the Earth Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Non-scanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide, the data contains a 30 byte header, 67 scale factors which were used to scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors which were used to scale the data in the second record. The data set also contained two records for each processed region. The first record was of fixed length (990 words) and contained averaged data. The second record was of variable length and contained individual hour box estimates. The length of the second record, in words, was calculated by multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the non-scanner)."
"Thorleaf Research, Inc. proposes to develop a miniaturized high pressure atmospheric sampling inlet system for sample acquisition in extreme planetary environments, such as those encountered in the lower troposphere of Venus or the atmospheres of the gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. This addresses a key technology gap for planetary studies, mainly how to acquire and prepare samples for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints. Although miniaturized mass spectrometers and other low power instruments are under development by NASA for in situ measurements, the great potential of such instrumentation for exploration of the Solar System will not be realized without complementary developments in the technology for collecting and preparing samples for analysis.  Our proposed approach collects an atmospheric gas micro-sample at high pressure and transfers it into a protected low pressure environment within a small pressure housing for analysis by GC/MS, mass spectrometry or other techniques that inherently require low pressures for operation. This new technology will enable in situ measurement of the composition and key isotope ratios in high pressure planetary atmospheres down to trace levels."

"This project is directed to the development of low-loss, high power-density Aluminum Nitride (AlN)/Gallium Nitride (GaN) heterostructure based transistors for enabling high-efficiency solid state power amplifiers (SSPA) needed for advancing capabilities of future robotic and human exploration spacecraft. The AlN/GaN heterostructure is a particularly attractive system for switch-mode applications due to the extremely high charge density, high electron mobility, high intrinsic breakdown field, and physical thinness achievable and has seen widespread investigation toward solid-state amplifiers in the recent years. However, very few innovations have been proposed with this heterostructure despite its expansive capacity for various creative device concepts. A new patent-pending multichannel AlN/GaN Field Screening High Electron Mobility Transistor (FS-HEMT) design is described. Preliminary experimental results are presented validating design principles that will eliminate current collapse phenomenon at X- and Ka-band frequencies that has plagues traditional HEMT designs and will ultimately deliver a low-loss switch-mode device."

"To address the NASA need for an extravehicular activity (EVA) information display device, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance development of a new Projection/Reflection Heads-up Display (Pro/Ref-HUD) based on innovative integration of liquid crystal display (LCD) screen projectors, partially see-through optical reflectors and unique ergonomic designs. This approach enables the displayed image to meet NASA EVA requirements and is completely decoupled from the user's head while achieving full sunlight readability with automated rapid ambient light response. The Pro/Ref-HUD offers full-color, high-resolution collimated images, with large fields of view, highly suited to the space and weight constraints inside an astronaut's suit. In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Pro/Ref-HUD system by designing, building, and testing a TRL-4 prototype. In this Phase II, POC proposes to develop a fully functional prototype to demonstrate sunlight readability and SXGA resolution, investigate thermal and radiation issues, and analyze ignition safety due to a 100% oxygen operating environment as well as vacuum and extreme temperature environments. The results to be developed and demonstrated in Phase II will offer NASA capabilities to perform EVA operations with heads-up displays internal to the helmet enhancing crew situation awareness, comfort, and safety."

"The Command, Control, Communications and Information (C3I) environment will be significantly different for Constellation than for Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS).  Missions will operate not only in Near Earth round-trip latencies (RTLT) of seconds but also Near Mars RTLT of 10 to 40 minutes.  New classes of collaboration services are required to support the spectrum of Constellation missions and infrastructure.  Integrating popular collaboration tools such as Groove Virtual Office on Constellation C3I space-based components and networks will be a major innovation.  This project proposes experimental use in SBIR Phases II/III of ISS flight and ground capabilities to demonstrate new collaboration services for use in the Constellation program.  These new space-based and terrestrial services will greatly improve communications among all Constellation personnel over current techniques.  The approach includes:  1) Integrate instant messaging, e-mail, transcription, etc. with voice and video communications; 2) Design for automation and autonomy of space-based Constellation components; 3) Evolve development collaboration services into mission collaboration services over time; 4) Promote new collaboration standards, interoperability, standardized interfaces, and modularity; 5) Adapt the collaboration architecture to the ground and space networks and frameworks.  Client-server, peer-to-peer, or a hybrid architecture may be most suitable."
"The MCD43D67 Version 6 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter (m)) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each MCD43D product contains just one data layer. 

MCD43D62 through MCD43D68 are the NBAR products of the MCD43D BRDF/Albedo product suite for MODIS bands 1 through 7. The NBAR algorithm removes view angle effects from directional reflectances to model the values as if they were collected from a nadir view at local solar noon.

MCD43D67 is the NBAR for MODIS band 6. 

Users are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).

Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions

*	Observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.
*	MCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.
*	Better quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period. Collection 5 used only four observations per day.
*	The MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.
*	When there are insufficient high quality reflectances, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.
*	CMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid for MCD43D as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.

Important Quality Information
The incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&caseLocation=cases_data&type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products. In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1, 3, and 4 products."

"A Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) uses solid rocket motors to propel soil samples into orbit, but the motors cannot provide steering.  Cold gas thrusters are used for initial steering and spin stabilization for the final stage of flight.  This approach is heavy and results in a spinning sample container in orbit, which is difficult to recover.  Wickman Spacecraft & Propulsion Company (WSPC) proposes innovative hot gas thrusters for steering that use the gases from the solid rocket combustion chambers.  This approach reduces weight and provides a non-spinning orbiting container to increase mission success probability.

WSPC is the only company with hot, metalized gas valve technology.  The MAV valves must handle metalized gases at 5,600 F.  Minuteman motor experience and WSPC tests indicate that thin layers of tungsten in discrete valve locations would work for this application.   WSPC will create a layout of a MAV hot gas TVC system to ensure the weight is less than the baseline cold gas system.  Valve materials will be tested with the MAV propellant to ensure the valve operates properly.  Phase II will be the testing of the TVC system with the first stage MAV solid rocket motor to simulate a MAV ascent into orbit."

"NASA is seeking improved methods of rapid prototyping, which are best achieved by using directed metal deposition (DMD).  Current DMD systems consume a great deal of power, are inefficient, require significant flow of cooling water, and are fixed in one location.  To address the need for a rapid prototyping DMD laser, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new holographic optical element-based laser diode source (HOELDS) to replace conventional DMD lasers.  The proposed laser source is an innovative combination of extended laser diode arrays with a non-imaging beam combiner to produce over 500 W output in a 100 micron diameter spot.  HOELDS will greatly increase efficiency, resulting in a less expensive prototyping system that can be moved from laboratory to laboratory as needed, requiring only wall plug power, and cooled without water.  In Phase I, POC will design, assemble, and test a HOELDS model to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology.  In Phase II, HOELDS technology will be optimized to produce a prototype DMD laser for evaluation in an engineering environment.  This project will be followed by a smooth transition to a commercial prototype that will be compact, power-efficient, and portable."
"Successes to date with the use of integrated software framework tools have led NASA engineers and other researchers to expand the breadth, depth, and sophistication of the problems that they are attempting to solve. Both the utilization of ""high-fidelity"" physics based models (""depth"") and the total number of different engineering disciplines included in system models (""breadth"") have steadily increased. As model size and complexity grows, the number of engineers involved in the development and maintenance of these models is also increasing. Increases in system model size and complexity and the corresponding need for collaborative model development are beginning to stretch the limits of existing software frameworks. Large models are more difficult to build and maintain, while the inclusion of more people in the development process leads to model management and coordination issues. Enhanced and improved framework tools are required if NASA and industry are to continue to expand their modeling, simulation, and design capabilities. In this project, Phoenix Integration will develop an innovative software environment that will allow individual engineers and collaborative engineering teams to better build and manage large, complex, system models. Key elements in the solution include a new infrastructure for hierarchical model building (models within models), enhanced data linking and model verification tools, and an integrated version-controlled model and data library. These tools will combine to provide NASA engineers with a powerful and flexible environment for creating, maintaining, and collaborating on the creation, execution, and maintenance of large and complex system models."
"The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. 
			
			The innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.
			
			With MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses."

"In this paper, a maximum entropy-based general framework for probabilistic fatigue damage prognosis is investigated. The proposed methodology is based on an underlying physics-based crack growth model. V arious uncertainties from measurements, modeling, and parameter estimations are considered to describe the stochastic process of fatigue damage accumulation. A probabilistic prognosis updating procedure based on the maximum relative entropy concept is proposed to incorporate measurement data. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is used to provide the posterior samples for model updating in the maximum entropy approach. Experimental data are used to demonstrate the operation of the proposed probabilistic prognosis methodology. A set of prognostics-based metrics are employed to quantitatively evaluate the prognosis performance and compare the proposed method with the classical Bayesian updating algorithm. In particular, model accuracy, precision and convergence are rigorously evaluated in* addition to the qualitative visual comparison. It is shown that the proposed maximum relative entropy methodology has narrower confidence bounds of the remaining life prediction than classical Bayesian updating algorithm."

"LISTOS_AircraftRemoteSensing_NASAAircraft_Data is the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS) in-situ meteorological and navigational data collected onboard the NASA aircraft during the LISTOS field campaign. This product is a result of a joint effort across multiple agencies, including NASA, NOAA, the EPA Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), Maine Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and several research groups at universities. Data collection is complete.The New York City (NYC) metropolitan area (comprised of portions of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut in and around NYC) is home to over 20 million people, but also millions of people living downwind in neighboring states. This area continues to persistently have challenges meeting past and recently revised federal health-based air quality standards for ground-level ozone, which impacts the health and well-being of residents living in the area. A unique feature of this chronic ozone problem is the pollution transported in a northeast direction out of NYC over Long Island Sound. The relatively cool waters of Long Island Sound confine the pollutants in a shallow and stable marine boundary layer. Afternoon heating over coastal land creates a sea breeze that carries the air pollution inland from the confined marine layer, resulting in high ozone concentrations in Connecticut and, at times, farther east into Rhode Island and Massachusetts. To investigate the evolving nature of ozone formation and transport in the NYC region and downwind, Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) launched the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS). LISTOS was a multi-agency collaborative study focusing on Long Island Sound and the surrounding coastlines that continually suffer from poor air quality exacerbated by land/water circulation. The primary measurement observations took place between June-September 2018 and include in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation that were integrated aboard three aircraft, a network of ground sites, mobile vehicles, boat measurements, and ozonesondes. The goal of LISTOS was to improve the understanding of ozone chemistry and sea breeze transported pollution over Long Island Sound and its coastlines. LISTOS also provided NASA the opportunity to test air quality remote sensing retrievals with the use of its airborne simulators (GEOstationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) Airborne Simulator (GCAS), and Geostationary Trace gas and Aerosol Sensory Optimization (GeoTASO)) for the preparation of the Tropospheric Emissions; Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) observations for monitoring air quality from space. LISTOS also helped collaborators in the validation of Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) science products, with use of airborne- and ground-based measurements of ozone, NO2, and HCHO."

"In this Phase I research, ZeCoat Corporation will develop an affordable, low-stress silicon cladding process which is super-polishable for large UVOIR mirrors.  The proposed ion-assisted evaporation process is directly scaleable to SiC mirrors several meters in diameter.  The process is based on a novel, low temperature, ion-assisted, evaporation technique (IAD), whereby the coating stress of a silicon film may be manipulated from compressive to tensile, in order to produce a near-zero net stress for the complete layer.   A cladding with little intrinsic stress is essential to minimize bending that would otherwise distort the figure of very lightweight mirrors.   
Current methods to produce a polishable silicon cladding utilize CVD processes that produce highly stressed Si coatings.  The current processes require high-temperatures (hundreds of degrees Celsius) and are not readily scaleable to large mirrors.  CVD Si cladding is currently limited to mirror substrates less than 1-meter in diameter.   The proposed IAD process produces little heat, and the mirror size is limited only by the size of the vacuum chamber.
Large silicon carbide (SiC) mirrors (3-4 meters in diameter) are being considered for future space-based UVOIR astronomy missions.   These lightweight mirrors will likely require a highly-polishable layer of silicon (10 to 50 microns) applied on top of the SiC.   A relatively thick layer of Si is desirable for the purpose of reducing figuring time and for achieving a super-polished surface, suitable for UV astronomy. 
	Normal incidence 4-meter class UVOIR telescopes have been cited as a high priority by multiple government review panels including; the National Research Council's (NRC) study of NASA's Space Technology Roadmap and Priorities, The Office of the Chief Technologist, The Cosmic Origins Program and NWNH Decadal."
"High-power electric propulsion with Hall thrusters has been proposed as a strong candidate for Electric Path missions, but conventional power processing units (PPUs) are complicated and the mass of the discharge power converters needs to be reduced. Direct Discharge Power Processing Units (DDUs) have been proposed as an alternative due to their simplicity and low mass, but the achievable operating range of thrust and ISP is significantly limited because power regulation for DDUs is only achieved through gas flow control, array offpointing or shunting. This proposal presents a compromise between PPUs and DDUs called a Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Unit (HDDU) that provides a wider operating range than DDUs while reducing the mass and increasing the efficiency compared to conventional PPUs. An HDDU provides filtering like a DDU, but it can additionally raise or lower the discharge voltage over a limited range. An HDDU only processes the power necessary to raise or lower the discharge voltage. We propose using a soft switching non-inverting interleaved buck-boost circuit similar to what was built for Phase I, but with improved control circuitry and a modular chassis. Straight-through direct drive operation is possible by leaving the buck switches on continually while having the boost switches off.  The proposed HDDU would operate from an input voltage of 150 V to 300 V, and would provide 15 kW output power from approximately 200 V to 500 V. The HDDU approach is readily scalable to higher power levels by connecting modules in parallel because the proposed circuit naturally shares output currents. The HDDU will also include a digital control interface unit (DCIU), heater, keeper and magnet supply modules and driving circuits for a VACCO gas flow controller.  The DCIU will be controlled through a Windows GUI and a MIL-STD-1553 communication to USB adapter. The modular approach and enhanced operating range promote design re-use and reduce life-cycle costs."

"In order to carry out space-based science missions, NASA is responsible for designing, developing, and operating very complex, long-lived, and expensive systems.  Early investment in analyzing a wide range of options can produce markedly better designs.  That means pervasive modeling and simulation (M&S) early in conceptual design could pay large dividends for NASA, especially if M&S were cheaper to carry out, and if resulting models could be exploited throughout and across projects.
We propose to develop Model Annotations and Tools for Teamwork, Execution, and Reuse (MATTER).  This innovative technology will increase the efficiency and value of model-based systems engineering (MBSE).  MATTER will improve on existing SysML-based MBSE by defining new types of metadata that enable valuable processing capabilities not supported by the standard SysML language and existing tools: (1) Semantic descriptions capturing the intended uses of model fragments will encourage reuse, when combined with tools for managing and searching a model library; (2) Additional descriptions of model component interfaces will enable efficient composition and configuration of models; (3) Annotations on the behaviors and constraints of model elements will ease automation of simulation generation and analysis; (4) Tracking of model changes--including version branches representing alternate designs--will facilitate flexible trade analysis, model continuity and evolution across the project lifecycle, and teamwork; and (5) Generation and routing of change notifications will further coordinate team efforts, as awareness of shifts in inputs or the irrelevance of intended outputs will reduce wasted work.
During this project, we will design the system and develop a software prototype that illustrates the feasibility and utility of this approach."
"Tyvak, in collaboration with UCLA, proposes a novel approach to the challenge of creating a large reflector for Ka-band high data rate links.  We propose to attach the primary reflector surface permanently to the surface of a 6U spacecraft and illuminate the reflector using a Cassegrain style subreflector with an illuminating antenna that is permanently mounted to the transmitter / receiver inside the satellite.
While other approaches focus on deploying the reflector surface itself, including Tyvak?s own deployable dish project, this proposed innovation uses minimal moving parts to achieve a high gain design."

"This Phase I research proposal is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative architecture comprising control augmentation and on-line health monitoring system. This architecture integrats Flush Air Data System (FADS) with Reconfigurable Generalized Predictive Control (RGPC) technologies.  The Phase 1 effort includes identification and description of all supporting modules, their functionality and associated algorithm structures, connectivity, and final simulations using a specific aircraft for system performance evaluations.  Proof-of-concept study will include demonstrating the capability using selected aircraft health degradation and/or failure situations.  The concept innovation is derived from the prognostic nature of the system feedback used by the controller for applying corrective aircraft control.  In traditional controllers the errant transients possessing loss of control potential are detected after the fact and corrective actions for recovery are commanded by controller posteriori. The proposed system performs a real-time autonomous monitoring of aircraft surface pressure fields that contain precursor information for prediction of incipient errant transient motions.  The proposed system will enable reconfiguration of control based on measured pressure field anomalies that indicate standard control system equipment malfunctions."

"Innovative aerospace technologies constantly redefine the limits for what is possible, always pushing the envelope of every performance parameter and creating smaller, more efficient, more powerful instruments. However, such advances in technology usually require higher heat generation and greater thermal control needs. Novel thermal control systems built to handle these thermal challenges must be small, light-weight and able to maintain long-term operation in variable gravity under harsh conditions. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) conduction pumps control the flow of dielectric fluids via applied electric fields. These pumps have simple, flexible designs, no moving parts and good heat transfer capabilities. These pumps have been proven to be effective for long periods of time, in microgravity conditions, have flow distribution capabilities and perform better at smaller scales. 

The scientific literature lacks information on the behavior of the EHD conduction mechanism in nano-scale, where the simplifying assumptions of the mathematical models for larger scales no longer apply. The literature also lacks information about this technology's capability to distribute multi-phase flow in amsller scales, where two-phase flow in multi-channels is difficult to control in a stable fashion. Lastly, although EHD conduction pumps have been tested for prolonged use, the technology's ability to maintain control of the flow under disruptive operational perturbations has not been explored.
 
This project proposes a research plan for obtaining a fundamental understanding of the EHD conduction phenomenon as it pertains to small-scale, distributive flow systems under realistic perturbations, and to utilize this understanding to optimize the heat transfer performance of small-scale EHD conduction pumps. For this purpose, the mathematical models currently used for EHD conduction will be revisited and modified for smaller scales and for periodic and random perturbations. These models will be numerically solved and optimized for heat transfer performance. Experimental setups at various scales will be designed, built and tested in variable gravity conditions to verify the numerical results and ensure that the technology can withstand its expected working conditions when integrated with future aerospace systems.

Since the technology has already proven to be space worthy, this further optimization promises to make EHD conduction pumps extremely useful for aerospace applications ranging from microsatellite projects such as the CubeSat to crew quarter temperature management for future manned missions. Its reliability over long periods of time and minute power consumption make it ideal for long-term missions as well, making the EHD conduction offering very well rounded for future aerospace applications."
"A Level 2P swath-based Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset for the North Atlantic area from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the NOAA-19 platform (launched on 6 Feb 2009). This particular dataset is produced by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (NEODAAS) in collaboration with the National Centre for Ocean Forecasting (NCOF) in the United Kingdom. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day or more (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km.
NEODAAS-Dundee acquires approximately 15 AVHRR direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) passes per day over NW Europe and the Arctic. Each pass is approximately 15 minutes duration. These are immediately transferred to NEODAAS-Plymouth where they are processed into sea surface temperature (SST) products and converted to L2P specifications."
"FOR EXPERT USE ONLY.  This dataset contains estimates of geopotential field derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission measurements and a non-tidal oceanic model produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  The data are in spherical harmonics averaged over approximately a month.  The primary objective of the GRACE mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field variations.  This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 500 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 200 km apart, using a microwave ranging system.  In addition to these range change, the non-gravitional forces are measured on each satellite using a high accuracy electrostatic, room-temperature accelerometer.  The satellite orientation and position (and timing) are precisely measured using twin star cameras and a GPS receiver, respectively.  Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field affect the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently.  These differences are manifested as changes in the distance between the spacecraft, as they orbit the Earth.  This change in distance is reflected in the time-of-flight of microwave signals transmitted and received nearly simultaneously between the two spacecraft.  The change in this time of fight is continuously measured by tracking the phase of the microwave carrier signals.  The so called dual-one-way range change measurements can be reconstructed from these phase measurements.  This range change (or its numerically derived derivatives), along with other mission and ancillary data, is subsequently analyzed to extract the parameters of an Earth gravity field model."

"CAL_LID_L2_PSCMask-Prov-V1-10 data are CALIPSO Lidar Level 2 Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) profiles of PSC presence, composition, optical properties, and meteorological information along CALIPSO orbit tracks. The PSC data product ensemble describes the spatial distribution and optical properties of PSC layers observed by the CALIPSO lidar. Each file contains data from all nighttime orbit segments from a single day reported on a 5-km horizontal by 180-m vertical grid. PSC detection is limited to nighttime CALIOP observations because higher levels of background light during daytime significantly reduce the signal-to-noise and, hence, the PSC detection sensitivity. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) was launched on April 28, 2006 to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments, the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), the Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and the Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency, CNES."
"The VIIRS/NPP Thermal Anomalies/Fire 6-Min L2 Swath 750m NRT product is based on the MODIS C6 Fire algorithm. The input to the Active Fires production are Level-1B moderate-resolution reflective band M7, and emissive bands M13 and M15. The fire algorithm first calculates bands M13, M15 brightness temperature (BT) statistics for a group of background pixels adjacent to each potential fire pixel. These statistics are used to set thresholds for several contextual fire detection tests. There is also an absolute fire detection test based on a pre-set M13 BT threshold. If the results of the absolute and relative fire detection tests meet certain criteria, the pixel is labeled as fire. The designation of a pixel as fire from the results of the BT threshold tests may be overridden under sun glint conditions or if too few pixels were used to calculate the background statistics.

The VNP14_NRT product contains several pieces of information for each fire pixel: pixel coordinates, latitude and longitude, pixel M7 reflectance, background M7 reflectance, pixel M13 and M15 BT, background M13 and M15 BT, mean background BT difference, background M13, M15, and BT difference mean absolute deviation, fire radiative power, number of adjacent cloud pixels, number of adjacent water pixels, background window size, number of valid background pixels, detection confidence, land pixel flag, background M7 reflectance, and reflectance mean absolute deviation.

The product provides day and nighttime active fire detection over land and water (from gas flares). The VNP14 product provides fire data continuity with NASA's EOS MODIS 1 km fire product.

"Micro-resistojets offer the best combination of simplicity, performance, wet system mass and power consumption for small satellites (<100kg, <50Watts) requiring mN level propulsion and low to moderate deltaV(<500m/sec).  Classical competing devices such as cold gas thrusters have low performance, while liquid bipropellants have both high losses in the mN thrust range and are more complex.  The advanced EP devices such as colloid thrusters are suitable for sub-mN thrust while electrostatic or electromagnetic thrusters are suitable for large deltaV missions where their higher dry mass is offset by higher specific impulse.

Busek therefore proposes to develop a complete micro-resistojet system operating on ammonia or methanol delivering thrust up to 5mN, specific impulse approaching 300sec, impulse bit smaller than 1mNsec and power consumption lower than approximately 10Watts.  Ammonia was chosen because it is less toxic than hydrazine while offering similar performance.  Methanol is non toxic, greatly simplifying s/c fueling which is especially important for low cost missions.

In Phase 1, breadboard system will be constructed and tested on our Maglev thrust stand that can resolve microNewton forces.  In Phase 2 an Engineering Model of the system will be developed."

"CER_FSW_Aqua-FM4-MODIS_Edition2B legacy data are regional averages of instantaneous footprint computed fluxes [TOA, surface, and in-atmospheric (profile)], associated TOA observed fluxes, and cloud parameters only for the hours of satellite overpass (from CRS level2 product).The Monthly Gridded Radiative Fluxes and Clouds (FSW) product contains a month of space and time averaged Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for a single scanner instrument. The FSW is also produced for combinations of scanner instruments. All instantaneous fluxes from the CERES CRS product for a month are sorted by 1-degree spatial regions and by the Universal Time (UT) hour of observation. The mean of the instantaneous fluxes for a given region-hour bin is determined and recorded on the FSW along with other flux statistics and scene information. The mean adjusted fluxes at the four atmospheric levels defined by CRS are also included for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes. In addition, four cloud height categories are defined by dividing the atmosphere into four intervals with boundaries at the surface, 700-, 500-, 300-hPa, and the Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA). The cloud layers from CRS are put into one of the cloud height categories and averaged over the region. The cloud properties are also column averaged and included on the FSW.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999.

"The Nimbus-4 BUV Level-1 Radiance and Housekeeping Data in Telemetry Units collection contains the raw counts measured by the Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer every 32 seconds at 12 wavelengths between 250 and 340 nm during the daylit orbit portion. The data collection also contains ephemeris data, experiment subsystem status information, and spacecraft housekeeping and orbit data. This data collection was used to create the Level 1 Radiance U-Tape or RUT product.

The data were originally created on IBM 360 machines and archived on magnetic tapes. The data have been restored from the tapes and are now archived on disk in their original IBM binary file format. Each file contains about one orbit of data. The data files consist of 850 2-byte word records which are blocked in up to ten records. The first record in the file is the header record, followed by a series of data records, and ends with a trailer record. A typical orbit file is about 260 kB in size.

The BUV instrument was operational from April 10, 1970 until May 6, 1977. In July 1972 the Nimbus-4 solar power array partially failed such that BUV operations were curtailed. Thus data collected in the later years was increasingly sparse, particularly in the equatorial region.

"<p>Exhaust emissions from civil subsonic aircraft are the most significant source of pollution in the higher troposphere and lower stratosphere. However, reducing NOx emissions is at odds with turbine engine efficiency and performance: increasing thermal efficiency by boosting the pressure ratio in an engine by 30% leads to a 5% decrease in fuel consumption, but a 100% increase in NOx emissions. Accordingly, the aerospace industry is seeking&nbsp;methods to reduce NOx&nbsp; and CO2 emissions while maintaining or improving current turbine engine efficiency and power.</p>

<p>This proposal furthers the development of Thermatin, a novel germanate-based thermal barrier coating (TBC) top-coat material with phase stability to 1800C+. Thermatin&rsquo;s high temperature phase stability enables a potential 200C+ increase in allowable TBC surface temperatures in aircraft and industrial turbine engines over today&rsquo;s standard. This increase would directly support lower energy requirements for active cooling in lean-burn engines, reduced NOx and CO2 emissions, and improved overall engine efficiency.</p>

The proposed effort aims to demonstrate high temperature phase stability in thin coating form and optimization for resistance to CMAS attack. Our research efforts will be directed toward meeting performance requirements in the following&nbsp;areas: 1. establishing deposition parameters that&nbsp;produce phase stable Thermatin coatings with standard morphology using electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), 2. demonstrating&nbsp;high temperature phase stability in thin-coating form, and 3) demonstrating&nbsp;high temperature structural stability when exposed to CMAS contaminants.&nbsp;</p>"

"<p>We propose to design and demonstrate key enabling technologies for Cloud and Precipitation radars capable of closing the observational gaps left by current and upcoming missions (i.e., TRMM, CloudSat, GPM and EarthCARE), and identified by the cloud-precipitation science community as essential for the advancement of global characterization of the cloud-precipitation processes and their correct modeling in weather and climate models. The proposed instrument is Three-band (Ku/Ka/W-band) Cloud and Precipitation Radar (3CPR). 3CPR enables the simultaneous three-band observation, Doppler measurement, cross-track electronic scanning, and polarimetry). 3CPR achieves this using an extremely versatile and efficient antenna system referred to as ACPRA (Advanced Cloud and Precipitation Radar Antenna). ACPRA combines the high gain of a large parabolic-cylindrical reflector with the beam agility of an electronically-scanned feed system. The 3CPR configuration fulfills the draft requirements of a Global Cloud and Pre-cipitation Mission (GPCM). The Ka-/W-band subset of the 3CPR design satisfies all of the requirements and most of the goals of the Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) mission. It would also meet the requirements set by the snowfall measurement community. The key enabling technology meeting the requirements of GPCM and ACE is the W-band ACPRA. Using recent technological advancements in microfabricated interconnects and radiators, GaN and SiGe MMICs together with innovations in feed array design, we will demonstrate a W-band electronically-scanned array-fed reflector system. The reflector will be a scaled version of the 3CPR antenna with W-band scanning electronics. We will demonstrate this technology in thermal vacuum and vibration environments, advancing the key technology from TRL3 to TRL5. This TRL advancement along with a comprehensive instrument design and accommodation study to be performed during this task will bring the 3CPR instrument to TRL5, ready for Phase A start for ACE, GPCM, or other mission concepts by 2017.<p/><p>Develop and demonstrate key enabling technologies for a spaceborne three-band (Ku/Ka/W-band) 3CPR capable of simultaneous three-frequency, Doppler, cross-track scanning, and polarimetric measurements of hydrometeors (clouds, rainfall, snowfall). 3CPR will: - enable global characterization of cloud-precipitation processes and their correct representation in weather and climate models - fulfill all radar requirements for the ACE measurement concept, the anticipated radar requirements in the post-GPM mission era, and those set by snowfall science community.

"For long-term exploratory space travel, there will be a critical need for in-situ diagnosis and assessment of biological specimens from symptomatic astronauts, especially, disease pathogens (virus, bacterium, or fungus) and microbial contaminants. Hence, a real-time, non-culture-based microbial detection, identification and quantification system for on-flight monitoring and evaluation of pathogens from astronauts, or the space environment, is strongly desired. The success of such diagnostic tasks critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel miniaturized, point-of-care (POC) detector for reagent-free, no-culturing, in-situ diagnostics of disease pathogens. The envisioned device will be compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated (requiring minimum human intervention), and highly cost-effective and power-efficient. In Phase I, we will develop a new type of electrochemical molecules and fabricate solid electrode-based probe for in-vitro demonstration of accurate and effective signal transduction of selective binding of pathogenic cells to the electrode as proof-of-principle. In Phase II, the electrode probe will be optimized to increase specificity, sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular biological samples.

This framework will provide a state-of-the-art multiphase unsteady turbulent flow simulation capability employing Hybrid RANS-LES (HRLES) methods which are a blend of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approaches.  Robust primary atomization models for liquid jet breakup and both phenomenological and stochastic secondary droplet breakup models will be developed.  Lagrangian particle tracking and Eulerian multiphase models will be coupled to enable simulation of multiphase combustion involving solid particles or liquid droplets.

"Since high temperature Sm-Co based magnets were developed, a number of new applications have been introduced.  NASA?s Xe+ ion propulsion engine used in Deep Space I (DS-I) is a prime example. The magnets with coating perform well at temperatures up to 550?C.  Magnets without coating perform well in the current 10 kW Xe+ ion engines in the vacuum which exists in space and at temperatures up to 400?C. Additional challenges are expected in the missions NASA is planning.  The new missions, with higher-powered engines, include travel toward the sun, to Jupiter, and planets beyond. In these higher-powered engines (> 10 kW) temperatures are expected to reach 550°C in vacuum to ~10-5 Torr.  Technical data of the high temperature Sm-Co in the conditions of the NASA?s new mission are needed.  
This program proposes to study the effects of radiation on physical and magnetic properties, and the thermal stability and its improvement, in vacuum at temperature up to 550?C, of Sm-Co high temperature magnets.  Based on the results of this work, improvements to Sm-Co magnets will be made to enhance the performance of high power Xe+ ion propulsion engines."
"The Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) from NOAA-14 Level-2 daily product (SBUV2N14L2) contains ozone nadir profile and total column data from retrievals generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm. The v8.6 SBUV algorithm estimates the ozone nadir profile and total column from SBUV measurements using 1) the Brion-Daumont-Malicet ozone cross sections, 2) an OMI-derived cloud-height climatology, 3) a revised a priori ozone climatology, and 4) inter-instrument calibration based on comparisons with no local time difference.

The SBUV2N14L2 product is written as daily files using the HDF5 format, with file sizes ranging from about 1 to 5 Mbytes. Data are available from March 1995 through September 2006. The SBUV2N14L2 data product was used as input in creating the SBUV2N14L3zm monthly zonal mean data product."

"Picometrix's time-domain terahertz (TD-THz) non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technology could be used to inspect space flight structures such as inflatable space habitats, thermal protection systems (TUFI-type tiles, SOFI TPS), for voids, disbonds, and damage such as tearing and micron-meteorite impact.  The current instrumentation paradigm is that a multi-purpose TD-THz control unit is used to provide common drive, data acquisition, and analysis functionality to interchangeable sensors and imaging which connect to the control unit with a fiber-optic/electrical umbilical.  However, the current COTS control unit is substantially larger and heavier than would be desirable for a space-flight capable unit. In Phase II we will construct a prototype compact TD-THz control unit with a fiber optically coupled remote compact TD-THz reflection tomography sensor based on the Phase I designs. At the end of a successful Phase II, and transitioned into Phase III, we envision that a hand-held A or B-Scan NDE imager could attach to a control unit, sufficiently robust for spaceflight, no larger than a shoebox.  In Phase II, it should be possible to reduce the size of the control unit to approximately 1/3 of the current values to, for example, 14 in. X 10 in. X 4 in. and 15 pounds."

"The ""HIRDLS/Aura Level 3 Extinction at 8.3 Microns Zonal Fourier Coefficients"" version 7 data product (H3ZFC8MEXT) contains the entire mission (~3 years) of HIRDLS data expressed as zonal Fourier coefficients in 1 degree latitude bands from -64 to 80 degrees at 121 pressure levels. The coefficients are computed from the HIRDLS Level 2 profiles with a Kalman filter approach using both forward and backward passes in time. Expressed as the mean and up to 7 sine and cosine coefficients (4 waves for ascending and descending, 7 waves for combined), these coefficients may be used to compute values at any longitude. The data are provided on a pressure grid with 24 levels per decade, corresponding to about 1 km vertical resolution. The useful vertical range of the data is 215 to 20 hPa. The precision values are given by the root-mean square of the differences between the estimated fields and the input data.

The data are stored in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5), which is an extension of the HDF5 format. Each file contains a zonal object with data for the entire mission with separate data fields for ascending (daytime), descending (nighttime), and combined orbit node."
"ORACLES_Cloud_AircraftInSitu_Data are in situ cloud measurements collected onboard the P-3 Orion or ER-2 aircraft during the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) campaign.

"The goal of this project is to develop an innovative way of using Time Modulated Ultra Wideband (TM-UWB) transceivers (radios) to provide high performance integrated communication and relative navigation. Many future near-earth or deep space missions requires spacecraft operating in a formation. A unified transceiver that can perform multiple functions is highly desirable.  TM-UWB is an exciting new technology, whose small size, low power, robustness to interference, and very high data rate make it particularly useful for use on small satellites, and especially for satellites flying in formation because of simultaneous communication and range measurement capability.  Under the Phase 1 work we will primarily address the design issues of UWB transceivers for integrated communication and relative navigation.  The most important issue is the development and analysis of a high performance UWB communication/tracking scheme, which with current approaches can severely limit the achievable data rate and the update rate.  IAI proposes a novel approach to allow the same update rate as the ranging-only cases and the same data rate as the communication-only cases.   Under the proposed work we will develop the details of this scheme and analyze the system performance for integrated communication and relative navigation applications."
"Space motion sickness is characterized by symptoms of spatial disorientation, nausea, and vomiting. It affects approximately 70% of the crew during space travel and symptoms are commonly treated with intramuscular injections of promethazine. However, this countermeasure has had limited effectiveness and produces unwanted side-effects that include drowsiness and impaired performance. This study addresses PRD Risks: Risk of Therapeutic Failure due to Ineffectiveness of Medication; Risk of Impaired Control of Spacecraft, Associated Systems and Immediate Vehicle Egress due to Vestibular/Sensorimotor Alterations Associated with Spaceflight. Integrated Research Plan (IRP) Gap SM11: Can crewmember spatiomotor abilities be more accurately predicted and countermeasures and training techniques developed to mitigate spatial disorientation during spaceflight? The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate an alternative countermeasure for mitigating symptoms without the side effects commonly observed with anti-motion sickness medications. Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE) is a 6-hour physiological training program that has proven to be a highly efficient and effective method for enabling people to monitor and voluntarily control up to 20 of their own physiological responses, thereby suppressing motion sickness symptoms. In an earlier flight study, three astronauts were given AFTE during preflight training and three other astronauts participated as controls and were given a pharmacologic treatment. Shuttle crews were required to record data during launch, waking hours on mission days 1 to 3, and during reentry. They were required to practice AFTE for 15-minute inflight and apply control if symptoms occurred. Our findings indicate that 2 of the 3 astronauts receiving AFTE were successful at controlling symptoms in flight, while 2 of 3 controls were severely debilitated despite given anti-motion sickness medications.    <p></p>
Specific Objectives: 1) To determine individual baselines of physiological responses and tolerances to spatial disorientation in a rotating chair test simulating the  cross-coupled angular acceleration effects anticipated for Orion space craft re-entry; and 2) To evaluate AFTE effects for mitigating symptoms and improving tolerances to spatial disorientation.     <p></p>
Methods: Establish capability for providing remote AFTE training to any location. The study will include two groups of men and women, 10 subjects per group: Treatment - AFTE and Control no treatment. Each group will receive 4 exposures to rotating chair tests at one week intervals. All subjects will receive training on a manual dexterity and short-term memory task between tests 1 and 2. Subjects in the treatment group will receive a total of 6-hours AFTE training (two hours before the second, third, and fourth tests).     <p></p>
Deliverable: NASA Technical Memorandum and peer-reviewed journal article(s). We anticipate results of this study will demonstrate that AFTE provides crews with significantly better protection from the effects of spatial disorientation than adaptation training alone and without the side-effects of medication, thereby improving health,safety, and operational efficiency. <p></p>"
"<p>The harsh rocket propulsion test environment exposes any inadequacy associated with preexisting instrumentation technologies, can critically affect the collection of reliable test data, and justifies investigating any encountered data anomalies.  Novel concepts for improved system assessments are often conceived during the high scrutiny investigations by individuals with an in-depth knowledge from maintaining critical test operations.  The intelligent strain gauge concept developed for this project was conceived while performing these kinds of activities. Ordinary gauges are designed to provide test article data but they lack the ability to supply information concerning the gauge itself. Changes to the gauge bond integrity are observable in the thermal dissipation rate. A gauge is considered to be a ""smart gauge"" when it provides supplementary data relating Instrument attributes for performing diagnostic function or producing enhanced data.  Accordingly, a gauge with the ability to temporarily self-heat and monitor the rate at which the thermal dissipation occurs can indicate a gauge debond. This project developed novel strain gauge designs that enabled the detection of gauge debonding, and provided for temperature compensation of strain measurements. The improvement to the gauge increased instrument functionality and data collection capability. Two types of fully functional smart strain gauges capable of performing reliable and sensitive debond detection were successfully produced.  <p/><p>To improve instruments functionality in a harsh rocket propulsion test environment, this project developed an intelligent strain gauge.  The initial design for this project was a novel foil strain gauge with the capability to measure strain and temperature (Type 1).  The novel foil strain gauge pattern features the integration of a silicon-diode temperature sensor and a self-heating element. The silicon-diode sensor provides the gauge temperature for performing real-time temperature compensation algorithms. The silicon-diode temperature sensor was used in the initial gauge pattern due to its enhanced abilities, but after refinement, resistive temperature element was then embedded into a second gauge pattern (Type 2). Then, the debond detection function was tested by monitoring the temperature of the gauge while the gauge was heated and cooled. The temperature signature (rate of heating/cooling) from the gauge was analyzed for both bonded and debonded gauges. Finally, a small control circuit was created with the capability to self-execute a bond integrity check, and perform real-time temperature compensation was also added. By combining the control circuit with the special gauge the smart gauge was converted into a fully functioning intelligent sensor system.</p>"
"Autonomous multiple spacecraft represent a critical enabling technology
for future space missions. Currently, significant pre-flight planning
and ground tasking are needed to design operational sequences for
single-spacecraft missions. Multiple-spacecraft missions (especially
formation flying tasks) dramatically increase the complexity of
planning, sequencing and tasking, rendering them possibly intractable
for current mission design approaches. The overall goal of this effort
is to develop an Autonomous Dynamic Formation Planner (ADFP) applicable
to multi-spacecraft formation flying tasks, using systematic
methodologies for model-based prediction, optimal resource allocation
and task/activity sequencing and control. During the proposed effort,
SSC will develop and demonstrate an ADFP system for selected
multiple-spacecraft formation-flying tasks, using representative
constraints for onboard and formation resources. ADFP technology will
provide a general framework for implementation of onboard autonomy for
future multiple spacecraft missions, which is both resource and
constraint-aware. Our project team includes subcontract support from the
Research Institute for Advanced Computer Sciences, RIACS (a division of
the Universities Space Research Association), and the Colorado Space

"The AirMISR BARC 2001 data were acquired during a flight over the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) on July 21, 2001. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA. Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes. The 9 camera viewing angles are:0 degrees or nadir26.1 degrees, fore and aft45.6 degrees, fore and aft60.0 degrees, fore and aft70.5 degrees, fore and aft For each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are:443 nanometers, blue555 nanometers, green670 nanometers, red865 nanometers, near-infrared Two types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2)."
"Ultra-low capacitance quadrant InGaAs photoreceivers have been developed as part of the following successful NASA SBIR contracts by Discovery Semiconductors (DSC): (1) Phase I SBIR Contract # NNX09CD48P (01/22/09 to 07/21/09); and (2) Phase II SBIR Contract # NNX10CA59C (02/25/10 to 02/24/12).  The photoreceivers are based on low capacitance per unit area photodiodes, combined with a commercial operational amplifier, and have achieved low cross talk, low capacitance, and low noise.  With the successful completion of the design goals of the Quad Photoreceivers, the LISA community worldwide is eager to have these devices space-flight ready.  Thus, the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) FF is a perfect vehicle to launch these quad receivers in space, and operate them for 12 to 18 months in harsh conditions.  This view is strongly supported by Dr. Jeff Livas, Chief, Gravitational Astrophysics Laboratory, at NASA GSFC.  

Based on our prior experience with launching LIDAR InGaAs Photoreceivers on a MISSE 7 Flight, it is unrealistic to expect a MISSE FF launch in the 6 months short duration of this Phase I SBIR.  Thus, our Phase I objective will be to perform the five key MIL-STD Tests, on the LISA Gravity Wave InGaAs Quad Photoreceivers.  These tests will serve as a foundation for a potential MISSE FF Space Flight in Phase II SBIR of this program.

MIL-STD reliability tests to be carried out in this Phase I SBIR are : (1) Mechanical Shock; (2) Vibration; (3) Thermal Shock; (4) Temperature Cycling; and (5) Damp Heat (humididty)."

TES was an instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite and was launched from California on July 15, 2004. Data collection for TES is complete. The TES Science Data Processing L3 subsystem interpolated L2 atmospheric profiles collected in a Global Survey onto a global grid uniform in latitude and longitude to provide a 3-D representation of the distribution of atmospheric gasses. The L3 standard data products are composed of L3 HDF-EOS grid data. A separate product file was produced for each different atmospheric species. TES obtained data in two basic observation modes: Limb or Nadir; Nadir observations, which point directly to the surface of the Earth, are different from limb observations, which are pointed at various off-nadir angles into the atmosphere. The product file may contain, in separate folders, limb data, nadir data, or both folders may be present. Specific to L3 processing were the terms Daily and Monthly representing the approximate time coverage of the L3 products. However, the input data granules to the L3 process are complete Global Surveys; in other words a Global Survey was not split in relation to time when input to the L3 processes even if they exceed the usual understood meanings of a day or month. More specifically, Daily L3 products represented a single Global Survey (approximately 26 hours) and Monthly L3 products represent Global Surveys that are initiated within that calendar month. The data granules defined for L3 standard products were daily and monthly."

"In our Phase I effort we developed a prototype software-agent based framework to provide for autonomous re-targeting of sensors hosted on satellites in polar orbits, subject to standing requests and dynamic user requests.  Our approach is a distributed and de-centralized, with each satellite maintaining knowledge of its sensor complement and physical capabilities as well as its schedule. Each satellite is capable of entering into negotiations for a viewing opportunity via a Contract Net type protocol; and is capable of optimizing its bid.  As sensor deployment increases and autonomous vehicles become more robust, the need for a framework to support multi-sensor re-targeting in a dynamic environment involving multiple organizations becomes more acute. In our Phase 2 effort, we will extend the framework to include support for multiple types of sensor platforms as well as more sophisticated variants of the Contract Net Protocol. We will define various agent 'templates' specialized to the needs of the multi-sensor re-targeting environment. In Phase 2, the improved framework, AAMSRT, will support policy utilization to govern the sensor re-tasking. As part of the Phase 2 effort, we will engage the Open Geospatial Consortium for applicable standards, including use of SensorML, services, and OGC initiatives regarding sensor planning."
"Smart lighting systems in low energy commercial buildings can be expensive to implement and commission. Studies have also shown that only 50% of these systems are used after installation, and those used are not operated at full capacity due to inadequate commissioning and lack of personalization. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have great potential to enable personalized smart lighting systems for real-time model predictive control of integrated smart building systems. In this paper we present a framework for using a WSN to develop a real-time indoor lighting inverse model as a piecewise linear function of window and artificial light levels, discretized by sub-hourly sun angles. Applied on two days of daylight and ten days of artificial light data, this model was able to predict the light level at seven monitored workstations with accuracy sufficient for daylight harvesting and lighting control around fixed work surfaces. The reduced order model was also designed to be used for long term evaluation of energy and comfort performance of the predictive control algorithms. This paper describes a WSN experiment from an implementation at the Sustainability Base at NASA Ames, a living laboratory that offers opportunities to test and validate information-centric smart building control systems."
"POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP    <p></p>
1. Project Aims     <p></p>
The twinkling artifact (TA) is a rapid color-shift that selectively highlights hard objects such as kidney stones in color-Doppler ultrasound images; however, its inconsistent appearance has limited its clinical use. Our objective is to develop an ultrasound imaging protocol to enhance kidney stone detection in space, addressing ExMC Gap 4.13. In the 3rd year renewal proposal, the aims are: AIM 1: Develop, refine, and test in space analogs improved ultrasound imaging protocols to enhance kidney stone detection. AIM 2: Determine the effect of breathing gas composition on twinkling in swine. AIM 3: Determine the role of bacteria in twinkling.     <p></p>
2. Key Findings     <p></p>
Twinkling was reduced when 9 swine were exposed to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels (similar to what is found on the International Space Station (ISS)) with the degree of reduction in twinkling correlating with the concentration of CO2; twinkling increased when swine were exposed to 100% oxygen. When 4 swine were exposed to elevated CO2 levels versus normal air, there was an unrecoverable decrease in twinkling over the course of the study. Concentrations of gases in the blood and urine suggest both O2 and CO2 contribute to twinkling. Imaged 7 human subjects in the hyperbaric chamber and found a statistically significant increase in twinkling when subjects breathe 100% O2 at 1.6 ATA (the decompression stop) compared to initial twinkling levels. Growing several different species of bacteria on sterilized stones did not induce or increase twinkling; bacteria grown on agar plates also did not twinkle. Found evidence suggesting the contribution of internal micro-cracks to twinkling in addition to the surface crevice bubbles. Low frequency ultrasound was found to enhance twinkling if already present on stones, but did not cause non-twinkling stones to twinkle. Published 2 papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals; 4 additional papers are in preparation. Presented at 5 scientific conferences including an invited talk at the Acoustical Society of America Meeting in Honolulu, HI. Mentored a Pacific Science Center summer high school student and a summer undergraduate student. Organized a Wide World of Sound Booth at Engineering Discovery Days as Chair of the Outreach Committee, Cascadia Regional Chapter, Acoustical Society of America. Was interviewed for 2 National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI)/University of Washington promotional videos and a book on women in science. Accepted a tenure-track assistant professor position in the Graduate Program in Acoustics, Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University.     <p></p>
3. Impact     <p></p>
We have discovered that breathing CO2 significantly reduces twinkling in swine and have shown that breathing normal air (0.04% CO2) is insufficient to restore twinkling. The results also suggest that breathing elevated O2 may restore or enhance twinkling, which is supported in our human hyperbaric study. Bacteria grown on sterile stones or agar plates was found to be insufficient to induce or enhance twinkling; bacteria may need to be present in the stone formation process to contribute to twinkling. While increasing the energy delivered to the stone or lowering the transmitted frequency has been found to enhance twinkling, there remains some stones that do not twinkle. Further investigation into the stone formation process and/or the presence or absence of internal micro-cracks, which have been shown to play a role in twinkling in addition to the surface crevice bubbles, may help elucidate why some stones are resistant to twinkling so new techniques can be developed.     <p></p>
4. Proposed research     <p></p>
While this project is ended with NSBRI, we plan to finish recruiting and imaging the last subject for the human hyperbaric study and plan to submit 3 more journal publications. We are also looking to investigate"

"In this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) effort, Leiden Measurement Technology (LMT) proposes to design and build the Fluorescence Lifetime Excitation Emission Spectrometer (FLEXEMS), a stand-off fluorescence spectrometer that uses multiple light-emitting diodes to excite fluorescence in samples from the deep-ultraviolet through the visible and employs time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) and steady-state photon-counting techniques to quantify the fluorescence properties of the target in order to detect and identify trace levels of organics in-situ.  The addition of fluorescence lifetime measurements distinguishes it from other compact, field-portable instruments available. The instrument will require no reagents or consumables and by simply placing the instrument on a sample of rock, soil, or ice, or other material it will be able to detect a wide range of organics (at or below the 10-100 ppb-level) including free aromatic amino acids; biomarkers including F420 (specific to methanogens), NADH, and proteins; PAHs; and porphyrins (e.g. chlorophyll). It will be designed with flight in mind so that mass, volume, and power-usage will be minimized as much as possible. The use of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and/or avalanche photodiodes (APDs) will make the system compact and rugged and thus suitable for future missions and ongoing field and laboratory studies."

Electric cars are not new; they were more popular and reliable at the turn of the twentieth century as compared to their gasoline powered rivals. However, the uncertainty in determining battery life plagued electric vehicles then as it does now. A recent report by the Consumer Electronics Association, ―Electric Vehicles: The Future of Driving‖, indicates that although these vehicles are increasing in popularity, running out of battery power on the road is the top concern for consumers (71% of adults surveyed). Thus developing advanced battery health management techniques is very important. the RUL pdf. This is turn can motivate and inform mission replanning activity. The PF prognostic framework can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of possible mitigation actions, thus improving operational safety and optimizing battery power."

"A collaborative project between Oregon State University and Auburn University is proposed on the topic of heat rejection. A unique and innovative method of phase-change heat rejection (condensation) suitable for microgravity environment is proposed. The overall objective is to characterize the effects of surface microstructures on film dynamics and heat transfer rate by variation of the microstructure size or surface conditions. The key innovation lies in the surface microstructure design of the condenser, which is in the form of repeating asymmetric ratchets. Together with an innovative evaporator design that is being currently developed by the PIs, the condenser will result in a phase-change thermal management loop that is capable of removing moderate heat fluxes, is passive with no electrical input or moving parts, is self-regulating, reliable and lightweight. The proposed technology is expected to exit the project period at TRL 2."
"AI Biosciences proposes to demonstrate the ability of a microgravity-compatible, compact, light-weight, and automated versatile sample preparation platform (VSPP) that processes samples from various sample matrices (swab, potable water, blood, urine, etc.) to yield high quality nucleic acids for downstream molecular detection and identification in a closed-cartridge system.  Its primary function will enable NASA to rapidly identify microorganisms that could affect crew safety.  This near-term deployable cartridge and platform system also has the option to perform isothermal and PCR amplification of nucleic acids.  This highly flexible system will allow previously complicated, labor-intensive, and time consuming processes to be carried out by a turn-key and closed system using pre-filled cartridges.  We have demonstrated on the ground in a laboratory setting that the entire setup for high quality DNA/RNA extraction from urine, whole blood, serum, and saliva can be achieved via simple and reversible retrofitting of a low-cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) based 3D printers ranging from $199 to $750.  The VSPP can also be used to capture and purify cell and protein targets.  The ability of having a dual-use 3D printer in-flight to carry out sample preparation and additive manufacturing in-flight can be an attractive option in long duration space flights."

"With the information age has come a dramatic increase in our ability to generate and collect data while the traditional techniques to analyze this tsunami of data have proven woefully inadequate. The amount of data collected and stored electronically is doubling every three years. Many researchers are simply overwhelmed by the amount of data. Scientific visualization remains the dominant form of data exploration but current tools are focused on image creation and lack the much needed embedded analysis capabilities. To address this urgent need, we propose to develop and introduce a first-of-its kind tool kit called SciViz2.  SciViz2 brings together key innovations in three separate fields of scientific visualization, data mining, and computer vision to offer an integrated solution for physics mining of the most complex of data sets;  multi-dimensional, multi-variate data sets. SciViz2 bridges the existing gap in software technology by providing a scalable knowledge discovery tool that combines the power of machine learning techniques with scientific visualization.

Our Phase I goal is to develop a prototype and demonstrate the viability of the solution by applying it to one of the most challenging data analysis problem, that is the data from peta-scale particle simulations.  The underlying physics involves complex interaction of multi-variates and the output involves both grid-based and particle phase space data with nearly trillion particles and over 200 TB of data from a single run.   Phase II activity would involve full development of SciViz2 and its dissemination to the wider community. Our close collaboration with NASA's HPC group will be heavily leveraged to test and release the software for open use."
"Version 5 is the current version of the data set. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 5. 

The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.

"Software testing is a complex and expensive phase of the software development cycle.  Effective software testing is especially important in mission-critical software, where erroneous behavior poses a risk to safety or mission success.  Automated test case generation can make testing more efficient and effective, saving resources and reducing risk.  Under Phase 1, Safeware Engineering Corporation successfully developed the algorithms necessary to streamline software testing by automatically generating test cases directly from SpecTRM-RL models.  SpecTRM-RL (Specification Tools and Requirements Methodology -- Requirements Language) is a requirements language that was designed to be highly readable, allowing even non-specialists to understand them, but is also completely formal.  Test cases generated from the black-box models written in SpecTRM-RL will focus on the intended behavior of the system.  The test case generation tool will be designed to allow the user to choose between a smaller set of test cases, allowing for more rapid error identification, and a larger set providing more comprehensive coverage.  The phase II effort will implement these algorithms, adding test-case generation to SpecTRM, the tool suite which allows for editing, analysis and execution of SpecTRM-RL models.  The new test case generation tools will be tested on the Max Launch Abort System."

A single sensor worn as a Band Aid like adhesive or strapped tag on the astronaut monitors cardiopulmonary rates. Additional sensors are worn depending on the detail of phonocardiograph diagnosis data desired. This system is based on the mature technology of phonocardiography now thought at all medical school. This system has advantage that tag sensors measuring many additional physiological functions can be added at later date. The extended bandwidth cardiopulmonary data can be displayed locally or telemetered to earth stations and reviewed by clinicians in any situation as desired."
"The AIRMISR_BARTLETT_2003 data were acquired during a flight over the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, target as part of the AirMISR deployments from the Wallops Flight Facility during the August 2003 campaign. This particular flight took place on August 24, 2003. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. There were a total of two runs during this flight. A run comprises data collected from nine view angles acquired on a fixed flight azimuth angle. Each data file from one run contains either: a) Level 1B1 Radiometric product from one of the 9 camera angles or b) Level 1B2 Georectified radiance product from one of the 9 camera angles. Browse images in PNG format are available for the Level 1B1 product and browse images in JPEG format are available for the Level 1B2 product. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA. Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes. The 9 camera viewing angles are: 0 degrees or nadir 26.1 degrees, fore and aft 45.6 degrees, fore and aft 60.0 degrees, fore and aft 70.5 degrees, fore and aft. For each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are: 443 nanometers, blue 555 nanometers, green 670 nanometers, red 865 nanometers, near-infrared Two types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2). The Level 1 Radiometric product contains data that are scaled to convert the digital output of the cameras to radiances and are conditioned to remove instrument-dependent effects. Additionally, all radiances are adjusted to remove slight spectral sensitivity differences among the detector elements of each spectral band. These data have a 7-meter spatial resolution at nadir and around 30-meter at the most oblique 70.5 degree angles. The Level 1 Georectified radiance product contains the Level 1 radiometric product resampled to a 27.5 meter spatial resolution and mapped into a standard Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection. Initially the data are registered to each camera angle and to the ground. This processing is necessary because the nine views of each point on the ground are not acquired simultaneously. Once the map grid center points are located in the AirMISR imagery through the process of georectification, a radiance value obtained from the surrounding AirMISR pixels"

The Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) is a five-channel visible/infrared radiometer, which builds on the heritage of theAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument flown aboard the NOAA series of Polar-Orbiting Operational EnvironmentalSatellites (POES). The VIRS detects radiation at 1 visible, 2 near infrared and 2 thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing determination of cloud coverage, cloud top height and temperature, and precipitation indices. The central wavelengths for the VIRS channels are 0.63, 1.60,3.75, 10.8, and 12.0 microns. All channels are in operation during the daytime, but only channels 3, 4 and 5 operate during the nighttime.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation."

JULY 2015 PROGRESS REPORT    
The second year of the project involved extending our qualitative literature review for identifying factors and metrics utilized for assessing human-automation system performance and safety. Additionally, a collaborative workshop was hosted by the University of Central Florida (UCF) research team to provide an opportunity for experts to share their insights regarding automation design and measurement, as well as to obtain feedback regarding our methods and findings from the project. Current efforts involve preparing to conduct subject matter expert interviews to obtain recommendations from potential end users to optimize the effectiveness and usability of the web-based metrics toolkit. Studies will be the focus of future efforts after the transition of team members to Rice University during the end of Year 2.    
AUGUST 2014 PROGRESS REPORT    
There is a heavy reliance of automation systems to complete tasks and sustain habitability in the spaceflight context. However, past research has shown that certain risks associated with human-automation interaction can have an impact on performance and safety. In order to design and integrate automation systems effectively, it is important for designers, evaluators, and operators to monitor and assess certain factors associated with human-automation performance and safety. In order for effective monitoring, access to valid metrics and resources to properly assess various conditions of the human-automation system can benefit in the design and application process for a variety of contexts, including spaceflight.    
The purpose of the research project is to conduct efforts in developing a metrics toolkit that can be practically utilized for evaluating design and applications of human-automation systems. In this case, a metrics toolkit is defined as a set of resources and metrics that can be used for determining what conditions in the human-automation system can impact performance and safety. Our project involves several phases in order to meet this objective: (1) theoretical framework development, (2) systematic literature review of metrics used to assess human-automation systems, (3) experimental validation of selected metrics.    
Year one efforts have been dedicated to the development of a theoretical framework to delineate how various factors can impact human-automation system performance, efficiency, and safety. The framework was guided by an initial literature review about critical factors that have been of interest regarding human-automation interaction. Based on our initial review, we have categorized and identified factors into three separate facets: (1) inputs, (2) processes, and (3) outcomes. Inputs involve the traits of the operator (e.g., personality, expertise), the automation system (e.g., reliability, level of automation), and context (e.g., environmental factors, nature of the task, task complexity). Inputs of each of these elements are not impacted by their interaction with one another, but can play a role in how the operators interact with the task environment and automation system during taskwork. Processes are variables that emerge from the interaction between the operator, automation agent, and the environment, and are considered the attitudinal, behavioral, and cognitive factors experienced by the user (e.g., trust, workload, situation awareness) that can impact the performance of the entire system. The outcomes are the dependent variables of interest, such as performance, safety, and efficiency. Based on our framework, it is theorized that the inputs and processes play a role in the outcomes, and tha"

"NanoSonic has developed revolutionary multifunctional, super lightweight, self-healing and radiation shielding carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites as a viable lightweight material for space applications such as primary or secondary structures on NASA vehicles, habitat modules, and pressure vessel structures.  While current composites are lightweight, they do not offer reliable methods for damage inspection.  These advanced materials offer the ability to self-heal upon impact and allow for micro crack damage inspection via DC or RF measurements.  During the Phase I program, this phenomenon was demonstrated on multifunctional smart structural composites consisting of: carbon fiber plies, NanoSonic's Thoraeus Rubber&#153; Kevlar Lightweight Shieling Veils (LSV), and our conductive self-healing microcapsules.  The innovative microcapsules are comprised of a corrosion resistant HybridShield polymer shell, a resin-rich core of self-repairing, room temperature curing polymer, and Al nanoparticles to impart EMI and radiation shielding as well as a conductive pathway between the conductive Thoraeus Rubber veils to monitor both damage and repair via RF measurements.  NanoSonic is working with Colorado State University, ILC Dover, and Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company to increase the TRL of this technology from 5-7 during the Phase II program via mechanical, RF, and radiation shielding measurements and space qualification testing."
"This is the new (GPM-formated) TRMM product. It replaces the old TRMM legacy product TRMM_3G31.

Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.

Estimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.

The method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The CSH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.

Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the CSH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.

As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the fate of sunlight in Earth environment, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure.

To understand how humans adapt to space environments many experiments can be conducted on astronauts while they work aboard the Space Shuttle or the International Space Station (ISS). We also need animal experiments that can apply to human models and help prevent or solve the physical issues we face in space travel. The medaka is a suitable model fish for studying space adaptation because in the second International Microgravity Laboratory mission in 1994 adult fish mated successfully in space during 15 days of flight. In 2012 another space experiment   Medaka Osteoclast   was performed. Male and female fish (6 weeks old at launching) were maintained in the Aquatic Habitat system for 2 months in the ISS. The RNA-seq analysis of tissues from these fish will revealed tissue-specific responsiveness and common stress responses during space adaptation.

The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017."
"The MCD43D40 Version 6 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) QA Snow Status dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter (m)) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each MCD43D project contains just one data layer. MCD43D40 provides snow cover information for the MCD43D products. 

MCD43D40 contains the snow status quality layer which identifies each pixel as either “Snow-free Albedo Retrieved” or “Snow Albedo Retrieved” for the acquisition period.  

Users are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).

Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions

*	Observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.
*	MCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.
*	Better quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period. Collection 5 used only four observations per day.
*	The MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.
*	When there are insufficient high quality reflectances, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.

The incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&caseLocation=cases_data&type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products. In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1, 3, and 4 products."

"A global map thermal+epithermal         neutron counting rates binned on twenty-degree quasi-equal-area         pixels is provided. The map was determined from a time series           of the rate of neutron capture by lithium in the lithium-loaded         glass scintillator, part of the +Z phoswich sensor on Dawn's Gamma      Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND). Neutrons in the thermal and           epithermal energy range contribute to the reaction. The data were       acquired while in low altitude mapping orbit, about 385 km from         Ceres' surface (about 0.8 body radii altitude). Prior to mapping,       the time series counting data were subjected to corrections for         variations in the flux of galactic cosmic rays and measurement          geometry, as described by PRETTYMANETAL2017."
"Sample return missions, by nature, require high levels of spacecraft autonomy.  Developments in hardware avionics have led to more capable real-time onboard computing platforms, which allow for the implementation of more sophisticated algorithms.  A real-time convex optimizer named COARSE (Convex Optimizer for Asteroid Rendezvous and Sampling Return) is proposed in order to efficiently guide path planning operations as well as spacecraft guidance and control.  COARSE consists of a series of high level goals with specific set of execution steps, rather than complex interaction with ground control.  This proposal plans to develop and simulate a basic optimizer for the purpose of a robotic spacecraft in proximity operations to an asteroid for a sample return mission, and implement in a spacecraft avionics software environment.  If follow on Phase II work is awarded, the optimizer can be matured to expand higher levels of system complexity and constraints, potentially dealing with tasking multiple spacecraft working in coordination."

"Impact Technologies LLC, in cooperation the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative Automated Contingency Management (ACM) concept for advanced propulsion systems that will provide a superior level of engine fault accommodation and optimized performance based on a seamless integration between the engine health management (EHM) system and the engine controller.   Utilizing a sophisticated engine simulation model with full transient capability and integrated control, a software-in-the-loop demonstration will be delivered that will be capable of realistically simulating various control sensor failures, actuator faults, and engine degradation scenarios with associated results obtained comparing the benefits of the ACM technologies implemented.  

The proposed ACM software hierarchy will act from the engine subsystems level up through the air vehicle level and will implement advanced fault-accommodating control, health management, and intelligent software agents to accomplish its goal.  The core innovations of this project include: 1.) The development of advanced fault detection algorithms for sensor, actuator and component faults in different flight regimes; 2.) The development of intelligent software agents for achieving optimal dynamic performance under faulty propulsion dynamics; and 3.) The development of reconfigurable control algorithms linked to the EHM system for guaranteeing the stability of the fault-accommodating control system."
This data set contains raw calibration and test images acquired by the Deep Impact High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD during the cruise phase of the mission.

"In response to NASA's need for low-cost deployable solar sail booms for mid-size (~1,000m2) solar sails, Roccor proposes to develop the composite Trussed TRAC (T-TRAC) Boom system.  Like the original TRAC boom, T-TRAC has a triangular cross section that flattens and rolls around a spool for packaging.  Unlike TRAC, T-TRAC is applicable to much larger scale boom designs.  The proposed design will advance TRAC technology through: 1) scaling up the cross-section size and length of the boom, 2) light weighting the boom through material re-distribution and removal, and 3) cross-section modification for enhanced strength. Preliminary analyses indicate these steps will achieve more than a 5X increase in TRAC Boom structural mass efficiency over recently developed high performance composite TRAC Booms, while maintaining an extremely compact roll stowed configuration that maintains heritage with NASA's solar sail mechanical architecture lineage.
The overarching Phase I objective is to conduct a preliminary design-analysis-fabrication-test loop for a T-TRAC boom capable of meeting requirements for NASA's future mid-sized solar sail mission.  Multi-scale micro-mechanics, laminate, cross-section, and full section analyses will be performed to quickly narrow the laminates and boom designs to a few candidates.  These efforts will necessarily be performed in close communication with material vendors to select a few laminates for short coupon testing prior to building proof-of-concept booms.  During Phase II, a four-boom T-TRAC solar sail system will be developed, and prototype units will be built and tested to establish performance for missions of interest to NASA."
"Spacecraft thermal control is a critical element to maintaining spacecraft, manned, unmanned or robotic, at proper temperatures for humans, instruments and electronics to function properly. Simple, passive thermal control in which excess heat is radiated to space via blackbody radiators used to be adequate, however, as spacecraft power levels increase and mission environments become more complex, more flexible and capable thermal control systems and mechanisms are needed. Variable heat rejection is an enabling technology to reliably vary heat rejection during human and robotic spaceflight missions with wide variation in thermal environments & vehicle heat loads. Quest Thermal Group is proposing a novel Variable Gas-Conductor Radiator (VGCR) that uses variable gas conduction within an IMLI structure to control heat conduction.   A VGCR could provide both high and very low heat rejection, operating as both effective radiators and high performance insulation, and capable of turndown ratios of 76:1. 
  
The NASA 2012 TA14 Thermal Management Roadmap stated radiator advancement is perhaps the most critical thermal technology development for future spacecraft and space-based systems. NASA is seeking unique solutions for thermal control technology providing low mass highly reliable thermal control systems.  As NASA moves beyond LEO, spacecraft must accommodate various mission scenarios and need variable heat rejection. Current state of the art variable radiators offer heat rejection turn-down ratios up to about 4:1.  

Phase I goals are to develop a new variable spacecraft radiator that can simply and efficiently provide a highly variable heat rejection using variable gas conduction within IMLI insulation, and prove feasibility of the VGCR concept to help improve radiator capabilities for future NASA and commercial spacecraft. A VGCR prototype will be modeled, designed, built and tested for thermal performance and variable heat rejection."
"The S&K Team proposes design of a tool suite, Autonomy Requirements Tester (ART), to address the difficulty of stating autonomous requirements and the links to clear testing plans. ART will represent autonomy requirements, test plans, and test results, and the relationships among them so that it is less difficult to state autonomy requirements clearly, to communicate test plans clearly among the full development team, to guide software development from requirements through acceptance tests, and to communicate test results in terms of the completeness with which the requirements have been tested. This will extend the state of the art by clarifying the progression from autonomy requirements to test results and make the tests more modular and reusable.

The S&K team will first identify representative autonomy requirements for a design reference mission and high-level descriptions of how to test those requirements in the developed system. The team will then design XML schemas to represent data structures that define autonomy requirements, related test objectives, related cFS messages, test specifications and results. Next, they identify ways to generate and execute those tests by publishing and subscribing to appropriate cFS messages to run tests and examine the results.  The S&K team will design information displays for showing relationship among requirements, test designs and results so that it is clear how thoroughly the autonomy requirements have been tested and how they performed.  The team will develop a concept of operations for ART.  They will prototype enough of the concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, write a final report, and deliver results along with submission of a Phase II proposal."

"The MYD11B1 Version 6 product provides daily per pixel Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) in a 1,200 by 1,200 kilometer (km) tile with a pixel size of 5,600 meters (m). Each MOD11B1 granule consists of the following layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, number of clear-sky observations, and emissivities from bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32 (bands 31 and 32 are daytime only) along with the percentage of land in the tile. Unique to the MYD11B products are additional day and night LST layers generated from band 31 of the corresponding 1 km (MYD11_L2) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD11_L2.006) swath product aggregated to the 6 km grid. 

Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions

* Removed cloud-contaminated LSTs from Level 2 and Level 3 LST products.
* Updated the coefficient look-up table (LUT) for the split-window algorithm with comprehensive regression analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) simulation data in bands 31 and 32 over wide ranges of surface and atmospheric conditions, especially extending the upper boundary for (LST – Ts-air) in arid and semi-arid regions. Increased the overlap between various sub-ranges to reduce the sensitivity of the algorithm to uncertainties in the input data (i.e., column water vapor and air surface temperature from MYD07).
* Made minor adjustments in the classification-based surface emissivity values, especially for bare soil and rocks land cover types.
* Tuned the day/night algorithm by adjusting weights to improve performance in desert regions where the incorporated split-window algorithm may not work well.
* Generated new gridded LST&E products with a 6 km spatial resolution for 8-day (MYD11B2) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD11B2.006) and monthly (MYD11B3) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD11B3.006) intervals in response to user community requests."
"This data set provides an integrated collection of (1) ground-based meteorological, radiometric, and vegetation measurements, (2) flux-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP), and (3) numerous vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery for three eddy covariance flux tower locations near Lincoln, Nebraska, USA. Land use surrounding the towers is cropland with corn and soybeans. Data are reported for selected days during the growing seasons of 2001 through 2008 only when ground-based crop canopy reflectance was measured. Algorithms developed to relate ground-based and satellite spectral information to GPP of the cropland adjacent to the towers are provided. AmeriFlux tower-based Level 2 measurements included photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), heat flux, and GPP estimates; see Section 2 for specific towers.Ground-based measurements on the corn and soybean vegetation surrounding the towers included total chlorophyll content (Chl) and leaf area index (LAI). Ground-based crop canopy reflectance was measured at 5.4 m above the corn and soybean canopy using hyperspectral radiometers (range 400 to 1100 nm) during the growing season from May to October in eight different years (2001-2008). This resulted in 173 measurement campaigns (18 in 2001, 31 in 2002, 34 in 2003, 31 in 2004, 21 in 2005, 15 in 2006, 14 in 2007, and 9 in 2008). Spectral bands from Landsat TM and ETM+, MERIS , and MODIS instruments were used to calculate vegetation indices. Vegetation indices related to chlorophyll can be used as a proxy for GPP because of the observed close relationship between GPP and Chl content in crops. Algorithms developed to relate spectral information to the GPP of the cropland adjacent to the towers are provided as companion files."
"The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document."
The current data set (version V1.1) is superseding the previous released version of Prelanding data set (RO-C-GIA-3-PRL-PRELANDING-V1.0): an issue occurred  in some tables was fixed; addressed all scientific RIDS.

"CER_ES4_J01-FM6_Edition1-CV is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)-like Monthly Geographical Averages Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) Flight Model 6 (FM6) Edition1-CV data product. Data was collected by CERES FM6 on JPSS-1 (now NOAA-20). Data collection for this product is ongoing. Note: Edition1-CV data are for instrument validation purposes only and not suited for science publications. CER_ES4_J01-FM6_Edition1-CV includes Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA) fluxes using algorithms identical to those used by ERBE, averaged regionally (2.5-degree, 5-degree, and 10-degree grid), zonally (2.5-degree, 5-degree, and 10-degree) and globally. The ERBE-like Monthly Geographical Averages (ES-4) product contains a month of space and time averaged CERES data for a single scanner instrument. For each observed 2.5-degree spatial region, the daily average, the hourly average over the month, and the overall monthly average of shortwave and longwave fluxes at the TOA from the CERES ES-9 product are spatially nested up from 2.5-degree regions to 5- and 10-degree regions, to 2.5-, 5-, and 10-degree zonal averages, and to global monthly averages. For each nested area, the albedo and net flux are given. For each region, the daily average flux is estimated from an algorithm that uses the available hourly data, scene identification data, and diurnal models. This algorithm is like the algorithm used for the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program.

"This dataset contains GIF images of polar-stereographic-gridded Sigma-0 retrievals over the Antarctic Polar region from SeaWinds on ADEOS-II subsetted and averaged twice daily at the local time-of-day (LTOD); local times are approximately morning (00:00 to 08:00 local) and evening (16:00 to 24:00 local). The eight hour interval at each LTOD reference of morning vs. evening corresponds to the natural boundaries of time separation within the data at polar latitudes. Hence, morning and evening are used as approximations for the LTOD reference, where the actual LTOD may vary within the respective 8 hour interval. It should be noted that these GIF images are meant for browse purposes only and should not be considered science quality. The GIF images are generated from a scientific dataset employing a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU); the science quality source dataset containing the SIR files used to generate the GIF images is accessible here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ANTARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_MAPS_LTOD.  The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively. The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized. As with the SIR files, the GIF images are separated according to polarization. For example, one SIR file for a particular day and LTOD will contain the gridded average Sigma-0 values derived from the horizontally polarized L1B retrievals, while the other will contain those from the vertically polarized L1B retrievals. This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU."
"Version 5 is the current version of the data set. Version 4 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 5. 

The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.

3GPROF products provide global gridded monthly/daily precipitation averages from multiple satellites that can be used for climate studies. The 3GPROF products are based on retrievals from high-quality microwave sensors, which are sensitive to liquid and ice-phase precipitation hydrometeors in the atmosphere."

"The GlobalView Carbon Dioxide (CO2) data product contains synchronized and smoothed time series of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at selected sites that were created using the data extension and integration techniques described by Masarie and Tans, (1995). The information needed to derive this time series is also in this data set, along with extensive documentation. The longest period of coverage is from 1979 to 2001 with some sites having longer or shorter temporal coverage. Note that the GlobalView CO2 data products are derived from measurements but contain no actual data. To facilitate heterogeneous CO2 data use in carbon cycle modeling studies, the measurements have been processed (smoothed, interpolated, and extrapolated) resulting in extended records that are evenly incremented in time. There are 92 files with this data set which includes 89 *.zip data files. The other three files include 2  files with site information, one comma-delimited ASCII file (.csv), and one .dat file, and one .dat file which is a single reference marine boundary layer matrix file which contains CO2 mixing ratios as a function of time and sine of latitude and is a by-product of the data extension procedure."
"Flight in the hypersonic regime is critical to NASA's goals because access to earth orbit and re-entry from orbit to earth or to other planets with atmospheres require flight through this regime.  Hypersonic flight poses a wide array of difficulties, including significant guidance and control challenges.  For example, flexible airframes and highly integrated airframe and propulsion systems common in scramjet designs mean that aerodynamic and propulsion control are closely coupled.  Control laws for hypersonic vehicles must also handle a very broad range of dynamics as hypersonic vehicles often operate from subsonic through hypersonic speeds and possibly with multiple propulsion modes for different speed ranges.  Actuator saturation and significant models uncertainty also pose control challenges, and demanding energy management requirements make guidance and trajectory optimization challenging tasks as well.  The proposed research will develop innovative control strategies to address the challenges of hypersonic flight.  These will be based on recent advances in switching control methods that provide large stable regions and disturbance rejection guarantees in the presence of actuator saturation.  The proposed control methods will ultimately be integrated with advanced guidance approaches for hypersonic vehicles developed by Barron Associates."

"ERBE_S10_MFOV_NF_NAT_1 is the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) S-10 Medium Field of View (MFOV) Numerical Filter (NF) Radiant Flux and Albedo data product. Data collection for this product is complete. It is available in the Native (NAT) Format.

ERBE was a multi-satellite system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget. The ERBE instruments flew on a mid-inclination National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10). Each satellite carried both a scanner and a non-scanner instrument package. The non-scanner instrument package contained four Earth-viewing channels and a solar monitor. The Earth-viewing channels had two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth, and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter. The former was called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter MFOV channels. The solar monitor was a direct descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor detector. Due to the concern for spectral flatness and high accuracy, all five of the channels were active cavity radiometers. The MFOV (medium-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10 contained inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and long-wave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month. This data set was produced for each of the satellites (ERBS and NOAA-9) and the combination of satellites, which were operational during the data month. The values for this data set were derived using the shape factor technique (Smith et al. 1986). As described in the Earth Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Non-scanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide, the data contains a 30 byte header, 67 scale factors which were used to scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors which were used to scale the data in the second record. The data set also contained two records for each processed region. The first record was of fixed length (990 words) and contained averaged data. The second record was of variable length and contained individual hour box estimates. The length of the second record, in words, was calculated by multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the non-scanner)."
"Currently the United States space program is recognized as the world leader in providing access to space.  However, in order to maintain this position, it will be necessary to reduce the very high cost of reaching low Earth orbit by using single stage or two stage to orbit vehicles.  Some components of these vehicles have exceptionally high heat loads and require additional cooling capacity, which can be accommodated by utilizing the additional fuel heat sink capacity available from endothermic cracking reactions.  Unfortunately, cracking reactions lead to coke deposition in the heat exchanger, which can be a potentially serious problem if it is allowed to accumulate. Therefore in this Phase I proposal, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) will develop methods to remove the coke from the heat exchanger flow path.  Previously, several different coke formation mechanisms were though to occur during cracking and the selection of an appropriate method to remove the coke would depend on the mechanism responsible.  However, as a result of previous work, we have identified the mechanism primarily responsible for coke deposition with JP-7 and JP-8.  Thus, the methods we develop in this SBIR Phase I proposal have a high probability of success."
